# Updating Mapping Guidelines

Update a group of mapping guidelines.

There could be scenarios when you need to update a MIG for a set of Mapping Guidelines such as changing the source or target MIG. Instead of manually changing this for each MAG individually, you can now update a set of mapping guidelines together using this feature. Follow the procedure below.

1.  In the MAG Overview page, choose *Update MAGs*. This will open the *Update Mapping Guidelines* wizard.

2.  In the *Select MAGs* step, select the checkbox of the MAGs that you want to update. You can also use the filter options provided in the screen to search for a particular MAG.
3.  Choose *Next*. The next screen *Select Action and MIG* displays the list of MIGs available in the system for you to choose.
4.  You can choose whether to change the source or target MIG using the radio buttons provided in the screen.
5.  Select the MIG from the list that you want to replace the source/target MIG with and choose *Next*.
6.  The *Compatibility Check* step does a validation check on the MAGs and displays the compatibility check between the MAGs and the MIG that you chose.
7.  The *Compatible* column next to each MAG shows the compatibility check of the MIGs.
8.  Select the MAGs again from the list that you want to update and choose *Apply Changes*.

    > ### Note:  
    > Do not close or leave the browser screen until the update is complete.

9.  A progress bar indicates the progress of the update in the *Results* step. You can also stop the update using the *Stop* button.
10. Once the update is completed, a table displays the result of the MAGs update.
11. The *Additional Info* column provides additional information on the MAG update.
12. Choose *Download* if you want to download the results. The information will be downloaded in the `.xlsx` format.
13. Choose *Close*.
