# Additional Attributes in OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI Specification allows you to define additional attributes or custom extensions that start with `x-`, such as `x-servers`. They can be used to describe extra functionality of the API that is not covered by the standard OpenAPI Specification.

Additional attributes or custom extensions are supported on the `root` level of the OpenAPI Specification and in the following places:

-   `info` section
-   `paths` section
-   `responses` section
-   `tags`
-   Security schemes

For the additional attributes that can be used with SAP OpenAPI Specification v2.0 see [here](https://github.com/SAP/openapi-specification/tree/main/sap-schemas/v2.0).
