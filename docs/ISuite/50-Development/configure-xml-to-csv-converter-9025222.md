    > ### Note:  
    > -   The converter doesn't support XML values with newline characters.
    > 
    > -   The CSV format will contain the values in the same order of occurrence of header and row tags in the XML.
    > -   When optional fields exists in the XML, the ordering is maintained in the order when a tag is encountered.
    > -   If there are namespaces declared in the schema file, the same has to be declared at the integration flow level and the namespace prefixes can be used in the XPATH expression.
