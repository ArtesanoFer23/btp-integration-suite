# Use Secure Protocols

To ensure secure communication with remote systems, check which protocols are supported by the system. We recommend that you use encrypted protocols, if supported by the system.

Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) protects data in point-to-point communications in the following ways:

-   Encryption of the transmitted data prevents eavesdropping.

-   Secured protocols also include verification of the hostname that prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.


The character of TLS to protect point-to-point communication implies that data is only protected during the transfer. Endpoints automatically decrypt messages so that data isn't protected during processing on the server.

In case you need end-to-end encryption check the guideline for message level security described at [Apply Message-Level Security](apply-message-level-security-9036c0c.md).

## Server Certificate Verification

Protocols with transport level security usually verify that the public key of the server is issued by a trusted root certificate authority \(CA\). Therefore, make sure that the SAP Cloud Integration keystore contains the right root CA certificates. You can use the connectivity test tool to get the CA certificates.

## Using SAP Cloud Connector

Several adapters allow you to select proxy type *On-Premise*. If selected, data traffic is tunneled via a secure connection to an SAP Cloud Connector in an on-premise network \(see: [Outbound: SAP Cloud Connector](../ConnectionSetup/outbound-sap-cloud-connector-642e87f.md)\).

There are different kinds of connections in SAP Cloud Connector:

-   HTTP-based connections \(when using an HTTP-based adapter such like the SOAP adapter, for example\):

    For such connections, you've to use the unprotected default protocol \(for example, HTTP\) in the endpoint configuration of SAP Cloud Integration. SAP Cloud Connector ensures a secure, TLS-protected transport via the tunnel to the on-premise landscape. For the last part of the communication from SAP CloudConnector to the backend system, you can configure either HTTP or HTTPS in SAP Cloud Connector. In this case, HTTPS is recommended.

-   LDAP connections:

    The same rules as described for HTTP-based connections apply for LDAP connections via SAP Cloud Connector. Select the plain LDAP protocol in Cloud Integration. The data is protected in transit via TLS tunnel, and in SAP Cloud Connector you've the choice between LDAP or LDAPS.

    More information: [SAP Cloud Integration – Cloud Connector & LDAP Integration](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/11/05/sap-cloud-integration-cloud-connector-ldap-integration/) \(SAP Community blog\)

-   Socks5-based connections \(when using the following adapters: FTP, SFTP, Mail, AMQP\):

    In this case, SAP Cloud Connector acts as a transparent TCP tunnel. When using such a connection, you directly configure the protocol used by the backend system in the SAP Cloud Integration endpoint. In this case, it's recommended to select the corresponding secure protocol variant \(mentioned in the table above\) in the configuration of the receiver channel.
