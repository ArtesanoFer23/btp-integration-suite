# Handling Integration Artifacts When Reusing an Integration Flow on Multiple Tenants

SAP Cloud Integration allows you to transport integration packages from a source tenant to a target tenant in order to re-use the content of the integration package \(integration flows, value mappings, OData APIs\) on the target tenant.

However, having transported an integration package to a target tenant does not mean that the contained integration flows run without any further actions.

For example, you need to make sure that security material and keystore content that is used/referenced by the integration flow is as well available on the target tenant. If that is not the case, the integration flow will fail.

This topic provides an overview of how to handle the different kinds of artifacts to make sure that integration content can be executed without errors also on the target tenant.

When you plan to automate certain manual steps described in this topic, you can use the SAP Cloud Integration OData API.

For example, you can facilitate steps like:

-   Reading a security artifact from the source tenant and adding it to the target tenant

-   Exporting a certificate from the source tenant and importing it to the target tenant

-   Generating a key pair

-   Creating a certificate-to-user mapping
