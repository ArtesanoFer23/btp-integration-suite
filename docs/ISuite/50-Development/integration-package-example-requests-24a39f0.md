## Import an Integration Package into the Design Section

To import an integration package into the *Design* section, send the following call:


<table>
<tr>

</th>
<th valign="top">

Resource Path



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

POST



</td>
<td valign="top">

 `/IntegrationPackages` 



</td>
</tr>
</table>

Provide the following request body:

```

{
"PackageContent":<base64-encoded package content>
}
```

If the package to be imported is in zip format, it has to be converted into **base 64 encoded** format.

> ### Note:  
> You can't import a package if there's already a package in the *Design* section with the same name. You can use the `Overwrite` parameter to overwrite the existing package. Use the following request:
> 
> `https://<host address>/api/v1/IntegrationPackages?Overwrite=true`

The part `https://<host address>/api/v1` is also referred to as service root URI of the API call. For more information on the address of an API call, see [HTTP Calls and URI Components](http-calls-and-uri-components-ca75e12.md).
