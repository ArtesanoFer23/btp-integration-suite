# Client Certificate Authentication \(Inbound\), Cloud Foundry Environment

Authentication of a sender is performed based on a client certificate. At runtime, the system checks if a service key is available that contains the client certificate provided by the sender. If a service key is available, the system then checks if the associated service instance has a role specified that grants permissions to call the integration flow endpoint.

## How it Works

The following figure shows the involved components and digital keys. For more information on the tenant keystore that comes with Cloud Integration, see [Keystore](keystore-b163513.md).

The table provides an overview of the required digital keys and their purpose in the authentication process, and summarizes the required configuration steps. Note that when setting up secure communication of different systems, typically administrators associated with the different systems need to accomplish configuration tasks in a coordinated way and to exchange public keys.

> ### Note:  
> For inbound HTTP connections, a load balancer component connects the remote sender system and the Cloud Integration tenant.
> 
> The load balancer terminates each inbound Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) request and establishes a new one for the connection to the tenant where the message is processed.

When defining the service key, the tenant administrator also specifies the role to be used to authorize the sender to call integration flow endpoint. You can either specify the predefined role `ESBMessaging.send` or a custom role.

> ### Tip:  
> Based on this setup of keys, the communication is established at runtime in the following way:
> 
> The sender connects to the load balancer and verifies the load balancer certificate. On the other way round, the load balancer verifies if the certificate sent by the sender system is valid. It's important that the client certificate installed on the sender system is signed by a certificate authority that is supported by the load balancer.
> 
> If the check is successful, the system checks if a service key is available that contains the sender’s client certificate. If that is the case, the role specified for the associated service instance is checked. If this role is identical to the one specified in the sender adapter of the integration flow endpoint \(addressed by the request\), the message can be processed.
