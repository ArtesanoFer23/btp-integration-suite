## Erasure of Personal Data

When handling personal data, consider the legislation in the different countries where your organization operates. After the data has passed the end of purpose, regulations may require you to delete the data. However, additional regulations may require you to keep the data longer. During this period, you must block access to the data by unauthorized persons until the end of the retention period, when the data is finally deleted.
