# Publish APIs

You need to publish APIs to make it consumable by external application developers. Publishing enables to expose the APIs in a structured manner in the form of a product. To publish APIs, you need to know how to bundle APIs and publish them together as a product.

A product is a bundle of APIs. It contains metadata specific to your business for monitoring or analytics. For example, all APIs related to CRM can be bundled as one CRM product. Instead of publishing APIs individually, it is easier to bundle related APIs together as a product and publish it. After including the required APIs to a product, the product is published to the Catalog, where the product is available for Application developers to browse through..

When you create a product, you link it to one or more APIs. Also, the same API can be linked to multiple products. After you have linked an API to a product, all attributes of the API such as API resources and API documentation are implicitly part of the product.

A product is a vehicle that lets the Application developer know which APIs are exposed on the API portal. When you create an application, you select the product to include in the application. For each application that you create, SAP API Management generates an Application key and secret. Use this key to gain access to multiple products.
