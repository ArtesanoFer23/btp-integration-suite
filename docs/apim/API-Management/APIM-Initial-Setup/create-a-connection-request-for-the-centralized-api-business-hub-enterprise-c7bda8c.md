## Prerequisites

-   To establish connections between the API business hub enterprise and Integration Suite API Management tenants, a Cloud Foundry space should be created in the sub-account from where the API business hub enterprise is hosted.

-   To establish a connection between an Integration Suite API Management tenant and the centralised API business hub enterprise which is available in a different sub-account, you must ensure that the API business hub enterprise capability is not enabled in the same sub-account as that of the API portal.

-   The following role collections should be assigned to you:
    -   AuthGroup.API.Admin

    -   APIPortal.Administrator: To generate the access credentials from the Integration Suite API Management tenant, you must have the *APIPortal. Administrator* role assigned to you.

    -   AuthGroup.APIPortalRegistration: You need this role to create a connection request and update the connection request credentials.

    -   APIPortal Service.CatalogIntegration: You need to have this role assigned to you as the client credentials is generated for this role.


-   Generate the access credentials to establish the connection.

    1.  Log in to the .

    2.  Choose the navigation icon on the left and choose *Settings* \> *APIs*.

    3.  Choose the *Connection* tab.

    4.  Follow the onscreen instructions under **Connect the API Portal to the centralized API business hub enterprise** to generate the Integration Suite API Management tenant access credentials.

## Context

The API business hub enterprise administrator identifies which existing or new API business hub enterprise application can accept content from multiple Integration Suite API Management tenants.

> ### Note:  
> Only new Integration Suite subscriptions with API Management capability enabled with the Integration Suite are allowed to set up a connection with the centralized API business hub enterprise.

> ### Note:  
> You can connect a maximum number of three Integration Suite API portals to the centralized API business hub enterprise.

Create a new subaccount in Cloud Foundry and set up only the Integration Suite API Management tenant.

For the newly set up Integration Suite API Management tenant, you can request for the API business hub enterprise connection to be established.

> ### Note:  
> The option to disconnect an Integration Suite API Management tenant from an existing API business hub enterprise isnâ€™t supported currently.

> ### Note:  
> Once this connection is set up, you can't place a request to severe this connection and establish a new connection with any other centralized API business hub enterprise.

## Results

You've submitted the connection request to the API business hub enterprise administrator. Once the connection request is approved by the administrator, you can start publishing the Integration Suite API Management tenant content to the API business hub enterprise.

> ### Note:  
> You can log on to the Integration Suite API Management tenant and check the connection status. Navigate to *Settings* \> *APIs* and choose *Connection*.
> 
> You can also choose *Test Connection* to get the details about the connectivity status once your connection request is approved. You will get a connection error, if the destination is deleted or configured incorrectly. In case of an error, retry after revalidating the destination configuration.
