# Starting the GPA Tool



## Context



## Procedure

Double-click the ***run\_gpa.bat*** file in the relevant tenant-specific directory.

If you start GPA without executing ***run\_gpa.bat***, gpa will use the default GNUPGHOME directory.



## Next Steps

As soon as you have started the GPA tool, the following files are created for the PGP Public Keyring and PGP Secret Keyring: ***pubring.gpg*** and ***secring.gpg*** \(see the following screenshot of the tenant-specific directory after tool launch\).

These files have to be deployed later on the tenant as PGP Public Keyring and PGP Secret Keyring.
