# What is API Management

Create simple digital experiences for your consumers, partners, and employees. 

SAP API Management lets you publish, promote, and oversee APIs in a secure and scalable environment.

The Cloud Foundry environment gives you the ability to subscribe to the API Management service, while you may choose a public infrastructure to run the API Management service, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.

## Use Cases

With the emergence of cloud, mobile and social technologies, new applications have become a driving force in the way people consume content and access services. Millions of mobile devices in use today are generating digital data at an exponential rate. This massive influx of digital information is changing the way businesses are operating. To keep up with the digital footprint produced, businesses identify and implement ways to reach out to their customer and meet their needs, easily and securely.

Through software interfaces called application programming interfaces \(APIs\), companies can provide business services and information directly to customers. APIs simplify the work of programming graphical user interface components for all types of apps on mobile devices, in the cloud, and on wearables. Exposing digital assets enable you to create and deliver content and business services to your customers, partners, and employees. That way they can better engage, collaborate, and innovate.

API Management technology helps you to share digital assets and enable developer communities to consume these assets in new channels, devices, and user interfaces. Available in the cloud, the technology helps promote coinnovation among employees, partners, and the developer community. To gain better insights about consumer needs, you can empower employees and partners with access to critical information and increase reach to a wider customer base.

API Management facilitates consumer engagement anywhere, any time. It reduces complexity by leveraging a single provisioning platform \(API Platform\) to provide unified access and governance of APIs across a heterogeneous landscape.

Get started by subscribing to API portal and API business hub enterprise applications where you can create APIs and consume them. For setting up the API Portal application, see [here](APIM-Initial-Setup/set-up-api-portal-application-29c281b.md). Once the API portal is setup, see [here](APIM-Initial-Setup/set-up-api-business-hub-enterprise-application-using-the-standalone-tile-80c0519.md) to set up the API business hub enterprise application.
