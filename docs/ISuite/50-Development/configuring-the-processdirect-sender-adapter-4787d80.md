# Configuring the ProcessDirect Sender Adapter

1.  Create a new integration flow \(this will be the custom integration flow\).

2.  Remove the receiver component.

3.  Connect the sender shape with the start message event and select *ProcessDirect* as *Adapter Type*.

4.  Configure the address of the ProcessDirect adapter as an externalized parameter in the same way as described in [Defining the Local Integration Process](defining-the-local-integration-process-88faa5c.md) for the ProcessDirect receiver adapter in the standard integration flow.
