# Onboard an Application Developer

Explains how API administrators can onboard application developers so they can access the API business hub enterprise.



## Context

A user must be onboarded to API business hub enterprise only via Self-registration or **Add User** flow.

To provide application developers with access to the API business hub enterprise, the API Administrator first has to onboard them. The steps to onboard an application developer are as follows:



## Procedure

1.  The application developers log on to the API business hub enterprise application with their IDP user credentials, and register to the API business hub enterprise. For more information, see [Register on API business hub enterprise](register-on-api-business-hub-enterprise-c85fafe.md).

2.  The API administrator approves or rejects the request to access the API business hub enterprise. For more information, see [Managing the Access Request of the Users \[Classic Design\]](managing-the-access-request-of-the-users-classic-design-5b3e2f6.md).

    If you haven’t enabled the automatic creation of shadow users, and you've not explicitly created shadow users for your developers, then they’re unable to log on to the application, and they’re asked to contact the administrator. For more information, see [Shadow Users](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4425026877144cc2b15505ed30215167/IAT/en-US/a0f5fe580ed846ca95f8601678509add.html "Whenever a user authenticates at an application in your subaccount using any identity provider, it’s essential that user-related data provided by the identity provider is stored in the form of shadow users.") :arrow_upper_right:
