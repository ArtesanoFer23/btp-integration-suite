# Custom Type Systems

The library of custom type systems allows you to upload custom messages – this enables you to create MIGs and MAGs based on your own message structures. Use cases for this could be proprietary messages, standard messages extended by you and messages from B2B standards not available in the SAP Integration Advisor . With this feature, you can:

-   Upload custom interface xsd files

-   Create MIG and MAG
-   Customize your MIG
-   View the list of your custom messages

To upload and use custom messages in SAP Integration Advisor , you need to have a custom type system. Follow the procedure given below to do the same.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to *Custom Type Systems* <span class="SAP-icons"></span> icon from the left pane of your application.

2.  Choose *Enable* to create a custom type system.

    > ### Note:  
    > Currently SAP Integration Advisor supports only one custom type system which serves as container for all your custom messages.

3.  Choose and open the type system. The *Overview* tab provides you with the following details :
    -   General information

    -   Documentation
    -   Administrative Data
