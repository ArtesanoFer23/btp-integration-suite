## Prerequisites

Create an instance of Content Agent and fetch the service keys. For more information, see [Creating an Instance of Content Agent](creating-an-instance-of-content-agent-359ecd7.md).



## Procedure

To create the service instance, follow the steps described in [Create SAP Content Agent Service Destination](https://help.sap.com/docs/CONTENT_AGENT_SERVICE/ae1a4f2d150d468d9ff56e13f9898e07/a4da0c26ced74bbfbc60e7f607dc05ab.html?version=Latest&q=destination).

After creating the destination, you can also do a *Check Connection* to verify whether you've added the destination correctly. Once you perform a check connection, the following pop-up message appears: ***Connection to "ContentAssemblyService" is established. Response returned: "401: Unauthorized"***

> ### Note:  
> In this case, 401 is an accepted response code.
