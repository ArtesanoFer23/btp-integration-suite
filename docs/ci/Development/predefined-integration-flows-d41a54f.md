# Predefined Integration Flows

The Cloud Integration Web application sets up predefined integration flows when OData objects are bound to a data source. These integration flows have the sender channel preconfigured to the OData adapter type.

A predefined integration flow has the minimum setup required for an integration scenario. You have to configure this integration flow to suit the specific requirements of your scenario.
