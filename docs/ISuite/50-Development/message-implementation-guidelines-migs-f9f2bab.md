# Message Implementation Guidelines \(MIGs\)



Message implementation guideline, also referred to as MIG, is used as the source or target in a mapping guideline \(MAG\) of SAP Integration Suite. This is created using one of the messages in the type system that is relevant to your scenario as the template.

The MIG contains all the information for implementing a customized message interface. SAP Integration Suite uses the message in a type system as a starting point to ensure that you don't have to refer to any additional documents to implement the interface. By providing a MIG, you ensure that all users who are involved in the process of implementing the interface have a clear understanding of the guidelines.

## Filtering MIGs

The *Message Implementation Guidelines* screen displays an overview of all the MIGs that you've created. Filters are used to search and display MIGs based on various criteria. You can use the *Free text filter* search or the <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Extended filter\)at the top of the screen to specify your search criteria. The *Free text filter* search allows you to filter and display MIGs that match your search text. It can be used as a quick filter to match your search text against multiple attributes of your MIGs.

You can also choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Extended filter\)to filter MIGs based on specific criteria. You can use the required filter fields to list MIGs that match your query. You can also customize the filter bar by choosing *Filters*. You can expand or collapse the filter area using *Show Filter Bar* or *Hide Filter Bar*.
