# Deploy an API Proxy

After an API is created, you must deploy the API to make it ready for product assignments.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the Integration Suite.

2.  Choose the navigation icon on the left and choose *Configure* \> *APIs*.

3.  To expose a service as an API, choose *Create*. See [Create an API Proxy](create-an-api-proxy-c0842d5.md) for the steps on how to create an API.

    Once you’ve filled in all the required details of the API, refer to step 19 in [Create an API Proxy](create-an-api-proxy-c0842d5.md) to *Deploy* the API.

    > ### Note:  
    > After deploying the API proxy, there can be instances where the policies or the base path added to the API proxy are modified and saved within the API proxy. In such scenarios, the API proxy gets automatically deployed, and the changes start reflecting over the internet.

## Results

Once an API is deployed, it’s available on the internet. The API can be called using the virtual host and the base path and can also be packaged as API Products.
