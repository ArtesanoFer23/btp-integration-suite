# Keep Readability in Mind

Readability of the integration flow is crucial for its maintainability.

> ### Note:  
> You can find the example integration flows that illustrate the guidelines explained in this section in the following integration package published on SAP API Business Hub:
> 
> [Integration Flow Design Guidelines - Keep Readability in Mind](https://api.sap.com/package/DesignGuidelinesKeepReadabilityinMind?section=Overview)
> 
> For more information, see [Copying the Integration Package and Deploying the Integration Flows](copying-the-integration-package-and-deploying-the-integration-flows-2cb1d31.md).

> ### Note:  
> If you don't consider the proposed guidelines during integration design, there's the risk that your scenario is affected in the following way:
> 
> -   It is difficult to understand the business logic of a scenario \(for topic newbies\).
> 
> -   It is difficult for the integration expert to maintain the scenario.
