    > You can click on the product profile name under *Name* field to see the available capabilities for the relevant profile.

2.  Choose *Edit* in the *Product Profiles* tab page.

3.  Select the radio button for the product profile you want to mark as default.

4.  Choose *Save* or *Cancel* as appropriate.
