# Adapter Development

For the development of custom adapters, you need to use Eclipse \(independent of the environment\).

-   In the Cloud Foundry environment, you can then deploy and manage the custom adapter as *Integration Adapter* artifact using the Cloud Integration *Design* and *Monitor* application.

-   In the Neo environment, you deploy the adapter using Eclipse.


See: [Developing Custom Adapters](../Development/developing-custom-adapters-7392cc4.md)
