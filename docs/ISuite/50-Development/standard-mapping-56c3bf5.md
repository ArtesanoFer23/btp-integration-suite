# Standard Mapping



The following figure shows the mapping used in this demo scenario.

The figure also indicates which fields correspond to the messages A and B as used in the concept overview in [Integration Flow Extension - Concepts](integration-flow-extension-concepts-41b238c.md).

In the standard mapping, the original message A is transformed in the following way:

The fields `supplierForename` and `supplierForename` are concatenated \(resulting in the field `supplierName` of target message B\).
