# Pod Security Standards

As described in the Kubernetes prerequisites section, using a policy controller like Azure Policy, Gatekeeper, or Open Policy Agent \(OPA\) is currently not supported.

If pod security policies or pod security admission controllers are used to enforce pod security standards, refer to specific pod security requirements for Istio, see [https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/requirements/\#pod-requirements](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/requirements/#pod-requirements).
