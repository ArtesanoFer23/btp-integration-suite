# Develop API-Based Integration Artifacts

Develop REST, SOAP, and OData API-based integration scenarios, deploy, and manage your artifacts in one place.

> ### Note:  
> This information is relevant only when you use the Cloud Integration capability as a part of SAP Integration Suite. Availability of this feature depends upon the SAP Integration Suite service plan that you use. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Note [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776).

You can create integration artifacts of types REST, SOAP, and OData APIs. The API-based artifacts generate a default integration design that you can further extend to meet your requirements. After you complete your integration design, you can save and deploy the artifacts. Finally, you can create your own tiles in the monitoring section to view your API-based artifacts that are deployed. For more information, see this [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/08/sap-cloud-integration-step-towards-building-api-based-integrations/).

Customers of SAP Cloud Platform Integration for process services can create OData API-based integration artifacts only.
