# HTTP Calls and URI Components



An HTTP call is composed of a **service root URI**, **resource path**, and **query options**.

To find the **resource path** and the supported **query options**, go to SAP Business Accelerator Hub and select the API. For example, to find the resource paths, the supported operations and query options for message processing logs, check out the [Message Processing Logs](https://api.sap.com/api/MessageProcessingLogs/resource) page on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.



How to get the service root URI, depends on the environment:

-   SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment:

    Open SAP BTP cockpit, go to the subaccount and choose *Instances and Subscriptions*. View the details of the service key that you have created when setting up inbound authentication for API access, and find the `url` parameter \(see [Setting Up Inbound HTTP Connections \(for API Clients\)](../ConnectionSetup/setting-up-inbound-http-connections-for-api-clients-8db3d51.md)\). Throughout this documentation, we refer to this part of the address also as **host address**.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you have set up inbound API access with basic authentication of an IdP user \(according to [Basic Authentication of an IdP User for API Clients](../ConnectionSetup/basic-authentication-of-an-idp-user-for-api-clients-57f104d.md)\), no service key is in place. In this case, create a service key \(with plan api as described at [Creating Service Instance and Service Key for Inbound Authentication](../ConnectionSetup/creating-service-instance-and-service-key-for-inbound-authentication-19af5e2.md)\), get the url parameter and delete the service key after you have retrieved the service root URI.

    The service root URI then is derived by appending `/api/v1`.

    The service root URI is then: `<url parameter from service key>/api/v1`.

    For example, to get all message processing logs with status *Completed*, use the following call:

    `https://12345abc.it-xyz789.cfapps.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com/api/v1/MessageProcessingLogs?$filter=Status eq 'COMPLETED'`

    In the example, these are the URI components:

    -   Service root URI:

        `https://12345abc.it-xyz789.cfapps.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com/api/v1` \(where `https://12345abc.it-xyz789.cfapps.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com` is the url parameter of the service key\)

    -   Resource path:

        `MessageProcessingLogs`

    -   Query option:

        `$filter=Status eq 'COMPLETED'`


-   Neo environment:

    Check out the address of your Cloud Integration user interface \(Web UI\). It ends with `/itspaces`.

    Remove the `/itspaces` and replace it by `/api/v1`.

    The service root URI is then: <code>&lt;Cloud Integration user interface address without /itspaces&gt;/api/v1</code>.




For more information about the service root URI, resource path, and query options, see [http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions).

> ### Caution:  
> The browser translates space characters to `%20`. If you paste a URL from this documentation to the browser, the OData call therefore works. The string `%20` is left out of the example URLs to make them easier to read.
