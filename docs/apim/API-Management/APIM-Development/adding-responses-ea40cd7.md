# Adding Responses

Define all the expected responses, including the response headers, response message, and error messages.

The server receives an incoming request and responds with a message indicating whether the request was successful or not. Such a response consists of the following elements:

-   An HTTP status code

-   Zero or more Response Headers

-   An optional Response Body


Use the standard HTTP status codes for describing the success or failure of the request. It is also recommended to use the HTTP response headers.
