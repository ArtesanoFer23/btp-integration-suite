# Create a Connection Request for the Centralized API business hub enterprise \[New Design\]

To publish content from different API portals \(available via API Management standalone subscription in Cloud Foundry\) to API business hub enterprise, establish a connection between them by creating a connection request.



<a name="loioc7bda8c2466143ea9675ef93e23b5147__prereq_wnz_n4r_f4b"/>

## Prerequisites

-   To establish connections between the API business hub enterprise and API Portals, a Cloud Foundry space should be created in the sub-account from where the API business hub enterprise is hosted.

-   To establish a connection between an API portal and the centralised API business hub enterprise which is available in a different sub-account, you must ensure that the API business hub enterprise capability is not enabled in the same sub-account as that of the API portal.

-   Raise an offline request to the API business hub enterprise administrator for assigning the *AuthGroup.APIPortalRegistration* role to you.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can't create a connection request, without the *AuthGroup.APIPortalRegistration* role.

-   You should also have *AuthGroup.API.Admin* role assigned to you.

-   Generate the access credentials to establish the connection. To generate the credentials from the API Portal, you must have the *APIPortal. Administrator* role assigned to you.

    1.  Log in to the API portal.

    2.  Choose the navigation icon on the left and choose *Onboarding Settings*.

    3.  Choose the *Connection* tab.

    4.  Follow the onscreen instructions under *Connect the API Portal to the centralized API Business Hub Enterprise* to generate the API portal access credentials.


    > ### Note:  
    > The client credentials get generated for the *APIPortal .Service.CatalogIntegration* role.

## Context

The API business hub enterprise administrator identifies which existing or new API business hub enterprise application can accept content from multiple API portals.

> ### Note:  
> Only new API Management, API portal subscriptions are allowed to set up a connection with the centralized API business hub enterprise.

> ### Note:  
> You can connect a maximum number of three API portals to the centralized API business hub enterprise.

Create a new subaccount in Cloud Foundry and set up only the API portal.

For the newly set up API portal, you can request for the API business hub enterprise connection to be established.

> ### Note:  
> The option to disconnect an API portal from an existing API business hub enterprise isnâ€™t supported currently.

> ### Note:  
> Once this connection is set up, you can't place a request to severe this connection and establish a new connection with any other centralized API business hub enterprise.

To create a request to connect the API portal to the centralized API business hub enterprise.

> ### Note:  
> This document describes the new design of the API business hub enterprise.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the *API Business Hub Enterprise*.

2.  Navigate to the *Enterprise Manager* \> *Manage Connections* and choose *Approved Requests*.

3.  Choose *Add New Connection*.

4.  Fill in the following details on the *Submit Connection Request* page.

    API Portal Alias Name


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Enter the API portal name that gets displayed on the API Business Hub Enterprise. This name is used to distinguish products that are published from the API portal and likewise for applications created for the product.

    API Portal Access Credentials


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Enter the API portal access credentials that you generated earlier. These credentials are used by the API Business Hub Enterprise to establish the connection.

    Sample credentials:

    ```
    {
      "url": "https://<application name>.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com",
      "tokenurl": "https://<name>.authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token",
      "certurl": "https://xxxxxx.authentication.cert.sap.hana.ondemand.com",
      "certificate": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > These credentials will remain valid for a period of 65 days. Please make sure to regenerate them and reestablish the connection within this timeframe.

## Results

You've submitted the connection request to the API business hub enterprise administrator. Once the connection request is approved by the administrator, you can start publishing the API portal content to the API business hub enterprise.

> ### Note:  
> You can log on to the API portal and check the connection status. Navigate to *Onboarding Settings* and choose *Connection*.
> 
> You can also choose *Test Connection* to get the details about the connectivity status once your connection request is approved. You will get a connection error, if the destination is deleted or configured incorrectly. In case of an error, retry after revalidating the destination configuration.
