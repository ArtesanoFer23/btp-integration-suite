# Creating OpenPGP Keys

You use the tool gpg4win to create the required keys for the usage of OpenPGP.

This section covers the creation of OpenPGP keys for tenants managed by SAP.

This description does not apply to tenants managed by customers. Customers might have their own OpenPGP key management processes.

The OpenPGP keys are maintained on the Windows VM on which the keys of the X.509 certificates are also maintained.

The kind of keys required depends on the use case and the role of the tenant for which the keys are created.

The following table lists the possible use cases and the required kinds of keys.

> ### Note:  
> As soon as you start gpg4win, files are created for the PGP Public Keyring and PGP Secret Keyring.
