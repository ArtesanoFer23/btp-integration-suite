# SSH Connectivity Tests



## Context

When you have selected the SSH connection type, the test tool checks if the SSH outbound connection reaches the associated SFTP server.

Depending on the chosen authentication, the following is checked by the test:

-   If the server \(host\) is reachable for the tenant
-   If the configured `known_hosts` file deployed on the tenant contains the certificate of the SSH server.



## Procedure

1.  In the *Manage Security* section, select *Connectivity Tests*.

2.  Select *SSH*.

3.  Define the attributes for the test.

    The host name must **not** contain any path or schema \(for example, `myHost.org`\). In particular, you must **not** enter a URL as the host name.

    <td valign="top">
    
    There are the following options:

    -   *None*

        SFTP server does not require any authentication of the calling component.

    -   *Public Key*

        SFTP server authenticates the calling component \(tenant\) based on a public key. If selected, a user name \(specified under *User Name*\) and the key \(specified under *Private Key Alias*\) are evaluated by the system to authenticate the tenant against the SFTP server.

    -   *User Credentials*

        SFTP server authenticates the calling component \(tenant\) based on the user name and password. To make this configuration setting work, you need to define the user name and password in a *User Credential* artifact and deploy the artifact on the tenant.

    -   *Dual*

        SFTP server authenticates the calling component \(tenant\) with two authentication methods: based on a public key and based on user credentials.

        At runtime, the system evaluates the values of additional parameters in the following way:

        -   For the authentication step based on user credentials: Credentials from the deployed artifact with the name given by the *Credential Name* parameter are evaluated by the system to authenticate the tenant against the SFTP server.

        -   For the authentication step based on public key: User name contained in the deployed artifact with name given by the *Credential Name* parameter and the key identified by the *Private Key Alias* parameter are evaluated by the system to authenticate the tenant against the SFTP server.

    Verifies the host key.

    -   *Against Tenant*

        Host key is verified against *known\_hosts* artifact deployed on tenant.

    -   *Against Partner Directory*

        Host key is verified against known hosts defined in Partner Directory..

        > ### Note:  
        > You can also load a known\_hosts file from the Partner Directory. To point to the Partner Directory content, you need to set the following property in the integration flow before calling the SFTP receiver adater:
        > 
        > `SAP_FtpPdUri` 
        > 
        > You can use, for example, a Content Modifier for this purpose.
        > 
        > The value of the property needs apply to the following format:
        > 
        > `pd:partnerId:parameterId:Binary`

    -   Off


    > ### Note:  
    > It is recommended to use this option **with particular caution** when you have selected *User Credentials* as *Authentication* because in that case you take the risk that you forward the password to an unverified server.

    Select this option if you like to check the access to the target directory. If you leave the *Directory* field empty, the default directory is your home directory.
