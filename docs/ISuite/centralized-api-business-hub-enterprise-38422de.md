# Centralized API business hub enterprise 

The API business hub enterprise is a central API catalog, allowing application developers to consume APIs and other assets, from a common platform.

> ### Note:  
> By default, the site administrator has the option to switch from the classic design to the new design and set the new design as the default user interface \(UI\) using the *Site Editor*. The site administrator also has the authority to enable a configuration that allows all other users to switch between the old and new designs.

If you have enabled API business hub enterprise and API Management tenant in the same Integration Suite sub-account, they will automatically connect to each other.

> ### Note:  
> Once this connection is established, you will not be able to connect the API Management tenant to any other API business hub enterprise enabled in a different sub-account. However, if you have not enabled API business hub enterprise in the same Integration Suite sub-account where you have enabled API Management tenant, you can connect this API Management tenant to an API business hub enterprise enabled in another sub-account and designate it as a centralized API business hub enterprise.
> 
> This centralized API business hub enterprise can be used to establish connections with multiple API Management tenants and can receive API proxies, API products, and other assets from each connected API Management tenants. It is important to ensure that all assets published to the centralized API business hub enterprise are unique.

> ### Remember:  
> You can configure multipleIntegration Suite API Management tenants to cater to different stages of the API lifecycle. For example, you can have separate instances for development, testing, and production. However, connecting these API Management tenants having such a relationship to the same API business hub enterprise will violate the uniquness of the assets.

Once the application developers register with the centralized API business hub enterprise, they can easily search, explore, and test APIs. They can also create and subscribe to specific types of applications available from the API business hub enterprise.

The API business hub enterprise admin identifies which existing or new API business hub enterprise application can accept content from multiple Integration Suite API Management tenants.
