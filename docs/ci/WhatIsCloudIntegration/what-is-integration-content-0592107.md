# What Is Integration Content

Operating business processes using SAP Cloud Integration implies the exchange of data \(messages\) between the participants. How messages are exchanged is specified by integration content that is designed based on the requirements of the business process.

As one key part of integration content, integration flows describe how a message sent from one participant is processed by SAP Cloud Integration.

In other words, using integration flows, specific integration pattern like mapping or routing can be specified.

For example, a set of integration flows specifies that a message sent from participant A is forwarded by SAP Cloud Integration to three different receivers B, C, and D, dependent on the business content contained in message. Integration flows also specify mappings of the data structure between sender and receiver or the endpoints of sender and receiver participants.
