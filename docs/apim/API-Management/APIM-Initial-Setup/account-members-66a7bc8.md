# Account Members

All members in your enterprise who need to use API Management applications need to be assigned to the account.



Members can use the application within the scope of the account and based on the roles assigned to the members. For information on how to assign members to the account, see [Managing Members](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/cc1c676b43904066abb2a4838cbd0c37.html?q=Managing%20memebers).
