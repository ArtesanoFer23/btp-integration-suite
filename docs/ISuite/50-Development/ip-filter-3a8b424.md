# IP Filter

The IP filter policy allows or denies calls from specific IP addresses or address ranges.

This policy is used to selectively allow or deny access for an IP address or group of IP addresses. Use this policy when you want to limit access to APIs to only a specific IP address or group of IP addresses. For example, if you only want systems \(computers, mobile, etc\) under the control of your enterprise to access the APIs exposed in your test environment, you can allow \(allowlist\) the IP address range for your internal network. Developers working from home can access these APIs using VPN.

> ### Note:  
> For the IP filter policy to work correctly, the *Client IP Preservation* feature needs to be enabled on the Edge Lifecycle Management. For more information, see [Deploy the Edge Integration Cell Solution](../deploy-the-edge-integration-cell-solution-ab81b84.md).
