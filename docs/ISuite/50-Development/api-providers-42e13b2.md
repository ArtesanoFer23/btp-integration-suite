# API Providers

An API provider defines the connection details for services running on specific hosts whose details you want to access.

Use an API provider to define not only the details of the host you want an application to reach, but also to define any further details that are necessary to establish the connection, for example, proxy settings. You can configure connections to OData-hosted systems from Integration Suite.
