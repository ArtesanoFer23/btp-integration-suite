For more information on how to provide authorizations, see [User Roles in API Management](https://help.sap.com/viewer/66d066d903c2473f81ec33acfe2ccdb4/Cloud/en-US/911ca5a620e94ab581fa159d76b3b108.html "Similar to other capabilities of the SAP Integration Suite, the API Management capability defines a set of technical roles that grant specific permissions to users. Users can be assigned roles through SAP BTP's role collection concept. While users have the option to create their own role collections, a set of predefined role collections is automatically created when the API Management capability is provisioned.") :arrow_upper_right:.
