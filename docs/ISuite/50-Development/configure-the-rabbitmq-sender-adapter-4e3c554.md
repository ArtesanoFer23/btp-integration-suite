# Configure the RabbitMQ Sender Adapter

The RabbitMQ sender adapter allows you to consume messages in SAP Integration Suite from queues on the RabbitMQ server. In addition,you use the adapter to send acknowledgements to the RabbitMQ server.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-business-accelerator-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a third-party web service that is outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your companyâ€™s policies.

Once you have created a sender channel and selected the RabbitMQ sender adapter, you can configure the following attributes.

Select the *General* tab to access the following parameters.

*Authentication* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Select authentication option to use to connect to the RabbitMQ server. There are the following options:

-   *Client Certificate*

    Connect to the RabbitMQ server using client certificate authentication.

    To use this option, you need to upload a certificate has to the keystore in the *Monitor* \> *Integrations* section under *Manage Security* \(*Keystore* tile\). Using the deployed private key, the adapter connects to the RabbitMQ server.

-   *SASL*

    Connect to the RabbitMQ server using Simple Authentication and Security Layer \(SASL\).

    To use this option, you need to deploy a *User Credentials* artifact in the *Monitor* \> *Integrations*section under *Manage Security* \(*Security Material* tile\). Using the alias name for the Credential, adapter will get username and password to connect to the RabbitMQ server.

<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Acknowledgement Type* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Specify the message delivery acknowledgement type. The following options are supported:

-   *Immediate \(Automatic\)*

    Sender adapter considers the message to be successfully delivered immediately after the message is consumed.

-   *After Processing \(Manual\)*

    Sender adapter decides when, and on what basis, an acknowledgement needs to be sent back to the RabbitMQ server. Positive or negative acknowledgement is sent depending on processing status of integration flow \(success or failure\).

    Protocol methods for acknowledgements: `basic.ack` and `basic.nack`

    `basic.ack` is used for positive acknowledgements

    `basic.nack` is used for negative acknowledgements

    Using negative acknowledgement type, a consumer is unable to process a delivery immediately but other consumers are able to process the message. RabbitMQ re-queues message for another consumer to receive and handle the message.
