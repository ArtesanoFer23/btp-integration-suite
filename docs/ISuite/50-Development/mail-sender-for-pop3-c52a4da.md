# Mail Sender for POP3

You use the mail sender adapter to download e-mails from mailboxes using the Post Office Protocol \(POP3\) protocol, to access the content of the e-mail body, and to access e-mail attachments.

To use this adapter, create a sender channel and as *Adapter Type* select *Mail* \> *POP3* \> *.* \(see [Overview of Integration Flow Editor](overview-of-integration-flow-editor-db10beb.md)\).
