# Malware Scanner for Cloud Integration

Scan your design time artifacts for malware before the users upload them to the tenant.

Users of the tenant upload various design time files like integration artifacts and their resources to the tenant. Such files are prone to malware attacks, which in turn, compromises the security of the tenant.

SAP Integration Suite provides a malware scanner that scans such files when a user attempts to upload them. By default, the scanner is disabled. You can enable the option under *Settings* \> *Integration* \(selecting the *Malware Scanner* tab\). With malware scan enabled, files of larger size can take a little longer time to complete the upload than when it's disabled. The files that are supported by the malware scanner are:

-   Documents that you upload within a package.

-   Integration artifacts like integration flows, value mappings, script collection artifacts, and API-based integration flow and their resources.

-   Integration packages

-   Keystore files like â€“ X.509 certificate, key pair, and keystore.

-   BinaryParameters resources when created for the Partner Directory using the OData API.


> ### Note:  
> Currently, JDBC drivers aren't under the purview of malware scanner.
> 
> Though not supported by the malware scanner, security materials like Known Host files, PGP public keyrings, and PGP secret keyrings are validated for format during upload. This format check prevents the upload of malicious content.

To enable the malware scanner:

1.  Go to *Settings* \> *Integration*.

2.  Move to the *Malware Scanner* tab and choose *Edit*.

3.  Enable the *Malware Scan* feature and choose *Save*.
