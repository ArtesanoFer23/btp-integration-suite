# Creating a Trading Partner Agreement

A trading partner agreement is an agreement of a contract defined by two trading parties that have decided to exchange certain business data or items using a B2B scenario for fullfilling the agreed trading/business process in a given business context.

Creating an agreement is the last step in the design of a B2B transaction and consists of tow trading partners representing one type of transaction between those two partners. Follow the procedure below to create a trading partner agreement.

1.  Log on to your Integration Suite .
2.  Choose *Design* \> *B2B Scenarios*.
3.  Navigate to *Agreements* tab and choose *Create*.

4.  This will display a list of agreement templates available in the system. Select the list <span class="SAP-icons">î‚¥</span> button next to an agreement template you wish to use.
5.  The next screen displays the list of transactions available under the template. Select one or more transactions from the list for your agreement and choose *OK*.

    > ### Note:  
    > SAP does not provide any pre-defined templates. Ensure you have the required template created before creating an agreement. To know more, see [Creating an Agreement Template](creating-an-agreement-template-9692cb1.md)
