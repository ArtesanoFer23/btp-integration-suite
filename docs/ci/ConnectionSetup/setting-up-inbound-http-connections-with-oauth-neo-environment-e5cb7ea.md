# Setting Up Inbound HTTP Connections \(with OAuth\), Neo Environment



## Context

> ### Note:  
> This information is relevant only when you use SAP Cloud Integration in the Neo environment.

The following use cases can be implemented for inbound communication:

-   Using the OAuth Client Credentials Grant scenario to support system-to-system communication

-   Using an OAuth SAML bearer destination to implement principal propagation between accounts

> ### Note:  
> This option is supported for the following sender adapter types: SOAP \(SOAP 1.x\), SOAP \(SAP RM\), HTTPS, and OData.

[OAuth Client Credentials Grant](oauth-client-credentials-grant-cf611ec.md "You can configure OAuth authentication, in particular the Client Credentials Grant variant, for inbound calls from sender systems to the integration platform. This gives the sender (client) application access to the associated runtime node through OAuth authentication.")
