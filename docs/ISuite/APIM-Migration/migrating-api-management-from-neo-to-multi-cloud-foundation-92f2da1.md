# Migrating API Management from Neo to Multi-Cloud Foundation

You can migrate the API Management content in Neo environment to a public cloud infrastructure \(hyperscalers\) within a multi-cloud foundation.



Migration Assistant for asset migration includes the tools and utilities that enable migration of design time assets nondisruptively from the Neo to multi-cloud foundation.

Your source system is the system that contains your API Management content in the Neo environment.

Your target system refers to the infrastructure that hosts your API Management content on a hyperscaler-managed infrastructure within a multi-cloud foundation. This multi-cloud foundation can either be your native standalone API Management subscription or the API Management capability within the Integration Suite.

For the migration assistance, you must have an Integration Suite subscription with API Management capability enabled within Integration Suite.

After completing the prerequisites mentioned in the steps below, you can clone your API Management artifacts nondisruptively from the source to the target system. Post cloning, you must complete some user actions and validate your target system.

> ### Note:  
> The developer portal is renamed to API business hub enterprise within the multi-cloud foundation. In this document API business hub enterprise is referred to as developer portal even within the multi-cloud foundation.

The steps assisting the migration of your API Management from your source system to a target system are:
