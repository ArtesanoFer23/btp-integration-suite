# Import from Data Source

Cloud Integration allows you to create an OData model by importing the model definition from an existing data source, such as SOAP and OData.

> ### Note:  
> When an OData API is generated not all attributes are copied from source metadata. However, once the OData API is generated, you can configure these attributes as needed in the OData Model Editor.

An import wizard guides you in this process with the following steps :

1.  Select a data source type.
2.  Select a structure.
3.  Verify and finalize the EDMX structure.
