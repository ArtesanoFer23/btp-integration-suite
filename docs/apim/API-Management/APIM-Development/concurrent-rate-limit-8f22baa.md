# Concurrent Rate Limit

 **The Concurrent Rate Limit policy is being decommissioned. The support for the Concurrent Rate Limit policy has come to an end. You can no longer create or update an API proxy with Concurrent Rate Limit policy. If youâ€™re still using the policy and wondering which policy to use to best meet your rate-limiting needs, see [Replace Concurrent Rate Limit Policy with Alternative Policies](replace-concurrent-rate-limit-policy-with-alternative-policies-b70e0d2.md)**.
