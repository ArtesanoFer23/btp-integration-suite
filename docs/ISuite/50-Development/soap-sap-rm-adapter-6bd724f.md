# SOAP \(SAP RM\) Adapter

You use this procedure to configure a communication channel with the SOAP \(SAP RM\) adapter.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a product profile other than the one expected \(see [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md)\).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow \(see [Product Profiles](product-profiles-8007daa.md)\). To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter, edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integraion flow.

SAP RM is a simplified communication protocol for asynchronous Web service communication that does not require the use of Web Service Reliable Messaging standards. A size limit for the inbound message can be configured for the sender adapter.")
