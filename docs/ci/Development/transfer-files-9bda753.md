# Transfer Files

Learn how to transfer files from an SFTP server.

You can find the example integration flows that illustrate the guidelines explained in this section in a dedicated integration package published on SAP Business Accelerator Hub. For more information, see [Copying the Integration Package and Deploying the Integration Flows](copying-the-integration-package-and-deploying-the-integration-flows-2cb1d31.md).

To apply those design guidelines, consider the following rules:

[Poll File by Done File](poll-file-by-done-file-800de6e.md)

[Poll Folder by Fixed Done File](poll-folder-by-fixed-done-file-0041751.md)

[Concatenating Files via Poll Enrich](concatenating-files-via-poll-enrich-694a60b.md)

[Combine XML Files via Poll Enrich](combine-xml-files-via-poll-enrich-7b97105.md)

[Poll and Merge Folder](poll-and-merge-folder-497bf08.md)

## Prerequisites

In order to run the sample integration scenarios, you need a connection to an SFTP server as explained in [Blog: Cloud Integration – How to Setup Secure Connections to sftp Server](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/08/03/cloud-integration-how-to-setup-secure-connection-to-sftp-server/).

In addition, if it is an on-premise SFTP server you need to connect it via Cloud Connector as explained in [Blog: Cloud Integration – How to connect to an On-Premise sftp server via SAP Cloud Connector](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/11/16/cloud-integration-how-to-connect-to-an-on-premise-sftp-server-via-cloud-connector/).
