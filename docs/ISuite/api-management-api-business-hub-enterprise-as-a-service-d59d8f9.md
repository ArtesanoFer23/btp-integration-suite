# API Management, API business hub enterprise as a Service

The API Management, API business hub enterprise as a service on Cloud Foundry provides the API access plan.

-   **apibhubenterprise-apiaccess**: The API business hub enterprise API Access plan allows you to generate a service key by creating a service instance. The service key, consisting of *url* \(application url\), *clientId*, *clientSecret*, and *tokenUrl* is used to generate a Bearer Token with the help of a REST Console. This Bearer Token, along with the application url and API endpoint are used to trigger the APIs.
