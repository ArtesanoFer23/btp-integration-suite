# Monitor Message Processing for Edge Integration Cell

The message monitor provides an overview of the messages processed on a tenant and allows you to display the details for individual messages.

Open the message monitor by clicking on a tile in the *Monitor Message Processing*area, and messages are displayed according to the filter settings of the tile.

If you navigate to the message monitor, only message processing logs from the chosen runtime are displayed.
