# Get Custom Tags Defined on the Tenant



To get all custom tags defined by the tenant administrator, you need to perform the following call:


<table>
<tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top">

 `â€‹/CustomTagConfigurations('CustomTags')/$value` 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Get all custom tags.



</td>
</tr>
</table>

Assume that you like to get all custom tags defined by the tenant administrator.

Send the following GET request:

`https://<host address>/api/v1/CustomTagConfigurations('CustomTags')/$value`

The part `https://<host address>/api/v1` is also referred to as service root URI of the API call. For more information on the address of an API call, see [HTTP Calls and URI Components](http-calls-and-uri-components-ca75e12.md).

If a mandatory custom tag with name *Author* is defined on the tenant, you get the following response:

```
{"customTagsConfiguration":[{"tagName":"Author","isMandatory":true}]}
```

If for the mandatory custom tag with name *Author* also permitted values \(for example, `Mr. Bean` and `Ms. Bean`\) are defined, you get the following response:

```
{"customTagsConfiguration":[{"tagName":"Author","permittedValues":["Mr. Bean, Ms. Bean"],"isMandatory":true}]}
```
