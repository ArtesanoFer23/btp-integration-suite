# Setting Up Principal Propagation \(Example Scenario\)

Use principal propagation to forward the principal \(identity of a user\) across several connections in a complex system landscape.



For more information on how to set up a scenario with principal propagation end-to-end, check out:

[Principal Propagation in SAP Integration Suite](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/principal-propagation-in-sap-integration-suite/ba-p/13528717) \(SAP Community blog series\)

In the following scenarios described there the component SAP Integration Suite is involved:

-   Propagate identity from an external system to an On-Premise SAP Backend with mediation

-   Propagate identity from a BTP application to an On-Premise SAP Backend with mediation


> ### Note:  
> The SAP Integration Suite adapters that allow you to set the authorization method *Principal Propagation* support such a scenario. However, when setting up such a scenario that spans multiple components and systems, you are responsible for configuring each component in the right way.
