# Use Prepackaged Integration Content Provided by SAP

SAP delivers prepackaged integration content out of the box that enables integration developers to get started quickly. These integration packages are created for some of the commonly used business processes.

SAP Integration Suite allows you to extend the capabilities of prepackaged integration content provided by SAP. This approach allows you to design custom integration logic without changing the content provided by SAP. To adapt the content to custom business requirements, you as the integration developer can edit and modify the related integration flows contained in the standard integration package. However, further updates to the standard integration content in the SAP API Business Hub can't be applied to the modified content in your design workspace. Copying the updated standard package from the SAP API Business Hub to the *Design* workspace of the tenant overwrites all your changes made to that package.
