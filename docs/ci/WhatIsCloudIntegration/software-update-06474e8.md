# Software Update

Cloud Integration software is updated monthly by SAP.

> ### Remember:  
> There are currently certain limitations when working in the Cloud Foundry environment. For more information on the limitations, see SAP Note [2752867](https://me.sap.com/notes/2752867).

The following applies for software updates.

-   Software updates are performed by SAP. Customers do not have to take any action here.

-   Software updates do not require any downtime of productive scenarios running on the integration platform.

-   SAP ensures that deployed integration flows continue running after the update.

-   In case a tenant is not accessible or shows component failures after an update, SAP is notified by appropriate alert mechanisms and triggers the necessary recovery processes.

    The *SAP Cloud Integration Terms and Conditions* specify details of service level agreements and system availability. You can find the SAP Cloud Integration Terms and Conditions at: [http://global.sap.com/corporate-en/our-company/agreements/index.epx](http://global.sap.com/corporate-en/our-company/agreements/index.epx).

-   If a specific integration flow stops working unnoticed after update, customers are asked to open a ticket. Choose the corresponding sub component under LOD-HCI-PI-OPS \(priority high\).
