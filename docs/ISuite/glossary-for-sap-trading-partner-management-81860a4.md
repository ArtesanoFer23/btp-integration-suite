Business Context



</td>
<td valign="top">

The Business Context has several entities representing categories such as business domains, areas of business and the geolocation of the trading partner.

<td valign="top">

Industry Classification



</td>
<td valign="top">

The Industry Classification context provides a description of the industry or sub-industry where the trading partner’s B2B scenarios take place. The classification is specified by using a value or set of values from the industry classification list provided by SAP.

Business Document



</td>
<td valign="top">

Business Document, also called Message Type is a semantical and formal business entity that is transferred between two partners. It defines either the representation at the source or target side.

The agreed and customized structure of a business document is usually provided by a message implementation guideline \(MIG\) from Integration Advisor or possibly in the end of an XSD structure representing the message.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Interchange



</td>
<td valign="top">

Interchange is a collective structure that specifies an acknowledgement or a collection of one or more Message Types contained within a type system specific envelope/header at the source and target side. In other words, an interchange is the incoming payload for B2B transactions. Each interchange in the end refers to the actual Business Document inside \(MIG, API etc.\).

The Interchange is always modeled in SAP Integration Advisor and the TPM application stores the Interchange references as a reusable \(CAWF\) resource to avoid redundant or multiple configurations within agreements.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Functional Group



</td>
<td valign="top">

A functional group is a part of an interchange, which embraces one or more business documents that are based on a same message type.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

System



</td>
<td valign="top">

System hosts one or more concrete end-points that can either send or receive business documents and acknowledgements.

The following 3 broad level of information are necessary in relation to system configuration in TPM

1.  *System Landscape Directory*: A directory that holds the details and purposes of available systems in the customer landscapes.

2.  *Technical connectivity configuration*: This defines the technical connectivity details of each system in the landscape such as, host, port, authentication etc.
3.  *Integration specific configuration*: This defines the fixed, semantical information for each system such as, supported type systems, adapter types, services, key sequences etc., that can be used during integration configuration.

System Type



</td>
<td valign="top">

The system type is meta-data that holds the name for the class of systems. The names are defined by the user.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

System Instance



</td>
<td valign="top">

System instances represent the physical points in the B2B landscape. In a trading partner agreement a system instance is either a physical starting point at the sender side or a physical ending point at the receiver side.



</td>

<td valign="top">

Communication Channel



</td>
<td valign="top">

A communication channel defines the communication for sending or receiving messages between the system and the middleware such as Cloud Integration or PO/PI.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Business Transaction Pattern



</td>
<td valign="top">

A Business Transaction pattern is a technical communication pattern that defines the behavioral aspects. These patterns are shipped as part of the product as boot strap content / configurations.

There are several different patterns that can be supported. The below is a comprehensive list of patterns but not all of them need to be supported in the initial delivery

-   Notification

-   Broadcast / Information Distribution
-   Request - Response
-   Query - Response
-   Request - Confirmation
-   Commercial Transaction / Offer – Accept



</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">

Interchange Flow



</td>
<td valign="top">

An Interchange Flow defines the direction and cardinality of a flow. It also defines the concrete flow semantics for a single Interchange within the pattern, that involves transferring a payload from a sender to a receiver. A payload here refers to a business document or a functional/application acknowledgement. A payload subsequently brings up mapping requirements, adapter configurations etc.

An interchange flow contains 2 sides – the sender and the receiver. Depending on an agreement template or a partner agreement, one side or both sides has to be configured. To differentiate the configuration sets between the sender and receiver, TPM uses something called configuration template that groups the transaction steps and related configuration specific to either the sender or the receiver.

The mapping is not part of either of the configuration templates but is in between. Mapping can be finalized only after both the sender and receiver side message types/interchanges are clearly known.

The interchange flow should also specify the quality of service required on the receiver direction.

Trading Partner Agreement



</td>
<td valign="top">

The Trading partner agreement is a configured and execution ready choreography based on the agreement between exactly two trading partners in where one trading partner is the Initiator and the other trading partner is the Responder. One of the trading partners should be the Company, which is the owner and user of the trading partner profiles and trading partner agreements at their tenant. It is based on a B2B scenario.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Agreement Template



</td>
<td valign="top">

An Agreement Template is a semantical definition consisting of one or more business transactions. It is by default partially configured for the customer side. Many configurations at the template level serve as defaults which can then be overridden at the trading partner agreement level. The full configuration is completed only at the partner agreement level.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Business Transaction



</td>
<td valign="top">

A Business Transaction is an instance of a business transaction pattern with business semantics added. It is a technical pattern configured for a specific business purpose. Semantics here means the actual business process names and the business entities/messages



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Business Transaction Quality of Service



</td>
<td valign="top">

The Business Transaction Quality of Service specifies the configuration of quality of service for a Business Transaction. This can be individually specified on each side of the transaction, either Initiator or Responder. This is an optional configuration.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Message Exchange



</td>
<td valign="top">

A message exchange defines a single step of a message exchange pattern. This step covers the configuration and processing from the source end-point to the target end-point.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Business Message



</td>
<td valign="top">

The business message describes the business message/document that gets exchanged at the whole message exchange. It covers the details of this message at business domain level.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Quality of Service



</td>
<td valign="top">

The following qualities of services describe the measurement and overall performance indicators of a message exchange step at initiators or responder side.

-   Time to Perform

-   Time to Acknowledge Receipt
-   Time to Acknowledge Acceptance
-   Formal or Informal
-   Has Legal Intent
-   Non-repudiation receipt \(on request/response\)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Message Exchange Pattern



</td>
<td valign="top">

A Message Exchange Pattern represents the message exchange configuration between exactly two participants. It is important to classify if each configuration belongs to the Initiator or Responder for the following reasons:

-   The Initiator and Responder configurations will be done at different points in time. So it is necessary for the User Interface to know which set of configurations to present to the end user.

-   The configurations in future Partner configurations will be exposed as a self-service to the actual partners.
-   Some configurations might have different role requirements



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Configuration Template



</td>
<td valign="top">

The Configuration Template serves the purpose of grouping configurations and adding required meta data to the different configurations of a Message Exchange Pattern. A Message Exchange Pattern needs exactly two Configuration Templates – one each for Initator and Responder.
