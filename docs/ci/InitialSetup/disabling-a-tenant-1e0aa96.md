# Disabling a Tenant

Tenant administrators can disable a tenant in Cloud Integration if the user wants to discontinue the service.



## Context

You can use the Cloud Integration Cockpit to disable tenants assigned to your consumption-based account.

> ### Note:  
> You cannot disable a tenant if the provisioning process is still running.



## Procedure

1.  On the service overview page, choose *Disable* to disable the subaccount.

    > ### Note:  
    > Disabling a tenant deletes all the data related to the tenant permanently, so you must be sure before you disable a tenant since this process is irreversible.

2.  Choose *OK* to confirm the action.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the process **fails**, please retry or create an incident as described in SAP KBA [2589823](https://me.sap.com/notes/2589823).
