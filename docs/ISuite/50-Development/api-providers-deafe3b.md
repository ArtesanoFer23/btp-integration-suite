# API Providers

An API provider defines the connection details for services running on specific hosts whose details you want to access.

Use an API provider to define not only the details of the host you want an application to reach, but also to define any further details that are necessary to establish the connection, for example, proxy settings. You can configure connections to OData-hosted systems from Integration Suite.

## API Providers Connecting to Backend System

If you want to configure the Integration Suite, solution to access data from a server that offers a specific service, for example, an SAP Gateway service, SAP HANA, SAP Process Integration/Process Orchestration, SAP S/4 HANA, or any 3rd party cloud solutions, you can manifest and expose the connection parameters as an API provider.

## Advantages of Creating API Providers

-   You can connect to different backend on premise/cloud system.

-   Discover services/interfaces.

-   Simplifies on-premise connectivity.

-   Simplifies configuration if the backend system changes.
