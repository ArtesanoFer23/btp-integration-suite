# Setting Up Outbound HTTP Connections

You can use various receiver adapters \(for example, the SOAP adapters, the IDoc adapter, and the HTTP adapter\) to connect the tenant to a receiver system through the HTTP protocol.

The following figure illustrates the basic setup for HTTP outbound communication:

## Outbound Connections to On-Premise Systems in the Customer Landscape

For connections like this \(when SAP Integration Suite sends a message to the on-premise system\) you have to make sure that the on-premise business systems connected to the cloud are not directly exposed to the Internet.

Therefore, a further component is interconnected between the on-premise system and the integration platform in the SAP Cloud that protects the on-premise system agains external calls \(from the Internet\).

There are two different options for this component:

-   SAP Cloud Connector

-   Reverse proxy \(for example, SAP Web Dispatcher\)




The following table lists the options for setting up secure connections for the different protocols. Consider the following table as a connection setup checklist. For a detailed description of the available properties for integration flow design, see the documentation of the individual adapters and integration flow steps.

Cloud Integration authenticates itself against receiver system is based on user credentials \(username and password\).

Receiver administrator: Configure keystore so that it contains certificate that is signed by a certification authority \(CA\) which is also part of the tenant keystore.

Tenant administrator:

-   Make sure that the tenant *Keystore* contains receiver server root certificate.

-   In integration flow / sender adapter, as *Authentication* option choose *Basic* and specify name of *User Credentials* artifact.

-   Create and deploy a *User Credentials* artifact that contains username and password.

Cloud Integration authenticates itself against receiver system is based on a client certificate.

More information: [Client Certificate Authentication \(Outbound\)](client-certificate-authentication-outbound-c4e4a15.md)

</td>
<td valign="top">

Receiver administrator: Configure keystore. This keystore must contain a certificate that is signed by a certification authority \(CA\) which is also part of the tenant keystore. Furthermore, it must contain the tenant client root certificate \(that identifies CA that has signed the tenant client certificate\), and a receiver server certificate \(signed by CA with which the tenant has a trust relationship\).

Tenant administrator:

-   Make sure that the tenant *Keystore* contains receiver server root certificate \(which is accepted by the receiver\).

-   Make sure that the tenant *Keystore* contains a client certificate \(including public and private key\) and receiver server root certificate which is accepted by the receiver.

-   In integration flow / sender adapter, as *Authentication* option choose *Client Certificate*. You have the option to specify the *User Private Key Alias* \(to refer to a specific key pair in the tenant keystore\). If you don't specify this attribute, any valid key pair from the tenant *Keystore* will be used for authentication.
