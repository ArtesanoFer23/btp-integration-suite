# Migrating API Management from Neo to Cloud Foundry Environment

You can migrate the API Management content in Neo environment to a public cloud infrastructure \(hyperscalers\) within the Cloud Foundry environment.



Migration Assistant for asset migration includes the tools and utilities that enable migration of design time assets nondisruptively from the Neo to the Cloud Foundry environment.

Your source system is the system that contains your API Management content in the Neo environment.

Your target system is the system that hosts your API Management content on the hyperscalers-managed infrastructure within the Cloud Foundry environment. Here Cloud Foundry environment can be your native standalone API Management subscription or API Management capability within the Integration Suite.

For the migration assistance, you must have an Integration Suite subscription with API Management capability enabled within Integration Suite.

After completing the prerequisites mentioned in the steps below, you can clone your API Management artifacts nondisruptively from the source to the target system. Post cloning, you must complete some user actions and validate your target system.

> ### Note:  
> The Developer portal is renamed to API business hub enterprise in Cloud Foundry environment. In this document API business hub enterprise is referred to as Developer portal even in Cloud Foundry environment.
