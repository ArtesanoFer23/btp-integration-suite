# Supported Components

Find out the components that are currently supported for migration.

In the current scope, migration tooling supports the migration of ICOs that contain the following components:

-   **Communication Channel**: HTTP, REST, SOAP, IDOC, FTP, SFTP, XI, RFC, JDBC, Mail, OData Sender and V2 Receiver, AS2 adapters

-   **Events**: Timer

-   **Flow Steps**: XSLT Mapping, Message Mapping, XML to JSON Converter, JSON to XML Converter, and Router


If your ICOs contain channels, events, or flow steps that aren't mentioned here, you would require additional effort for the migration. Hence, the migration of such integration scenarios isn't supported in the current scope.

Also, refer to the list of [Known Limitations](known-limitations-7a552d4.md) before you get started with the migration.
