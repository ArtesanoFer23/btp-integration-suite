# Create and Deploy an OData API Artifact

Use this procedure to create and deploy an OData API artifact.



<a name="loio8bc912d42c0a4cb284ecc08b4ea4e1b9__context_mn5_tdk_f4b"/>

## Context

We've unified the experience of creating all API artifacts with a single entry point. You now first the select the runtime profile of your choice and then move to appropriate steps to create the API artifacts that the runtime profile supports. For more information, see help

An OData API artifact creates an OData API-based integration scenario with the OData V2 sender adapter.

## Create an OData API Artifact



<a name="task_ytz_gq4_gpb__steps_vrz_3q4_gpb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Choose *Design* \> *Integrations and APIs*.

2.  Select the integration package where you want to create an SOAP API artifact and choose *Edit*.

3.  In the *Artifacts* tab, choose *Add* \> *API*.

    The *Create API* wizard opens.

4.  Select *Cloud Integration* from the list of available runtime profiles. For more information, see [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md). Choose *Next*.

5.  Choose *OData API* \> *Next*.

6.  In the *Select A Method* tab, choose *Create Using Template*.

    By choosing *Create Using Wizard* or *Upload*, you start creating an OData API project. See [Developing an OData API Project](developing-an-odata-api-project-d961654.md).

7.  Enter the name and description for the OData API.

    ID and Runtime Profile are uneditable fields.

8.  Choose *Create*.

    The artifact is added to the integration package and the API artifact opens up in the editor.

9.  Choose *Edit*.

    A palette appears on top of the integration flow model that provides access to all integration flow steps that you can add to the model. See [Overview of Integration Flow Editor](overview-of-integration-flow-editor-db10beb.md).

10. Make your changes and choose *Save*.

11. Choose *Deploy* when your artifact is ready for execution.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL of the OData API endpoint is derived from the name of the OData API artifact.

## Next Steps

You can check the status of all your integration artifacts in the *Monitor* view. By default, API-based artifacts don't appear in the *Monitor*. Perform the steps that follow to view the deployed artifact.

## View the deployed OData API Artifact



<a name="task_kgx_kq4_gpb__steps_jv3_4q4_gpb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Choose *Monitor* \> *Integrations and APIs*.

2.  Under *Manage Integration Content*, add a new tile.

3.  In the *Tile Settings* dialog, do the following:

    1.  Select *All* from the *Status* list.

    2.  Select OData API from the *Type* list.

    3.  Choose *OK* to create a tile.


4.  Open the tile to view your artifact and its status.

## Next Steps

Repeat the same process to create a tile under *Monitor Message Processing* to view the status of your processed messages.
