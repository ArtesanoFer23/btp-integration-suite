## User Interface Security

Cloud Integration provides user interfaces for designing and deploying message flows, and monitoring them at runtime.

A Web tool \(Web UI\) is available to accomplish these tasks. The Web UI is implemented using JavaScript and HTML \(UI5\).

This user interface is built to prevent vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting \(XSS\) and cross-site request forgery \(XSRF\). The built-in security capabilities of these technologies are used together with secure design and coding principles.
