# System Monitoring

Access system monitoring and logging if it's enabled.

The links for checking and accessing the System Monitoring and Logging function are displayed in the *Edge Lifecycle Management* UI, under *General* \> *Quick Links*.

Currently, by default the only available Grafana dashboard contains general system metrics like CPU, memory, disk usage. For additional dashboards, more specific to Edge Integration Cell components, see [3312134](https://me.sap.com/notes/3312134)
