# Configure

Configure API providers to define the connection details for services running on specific hosts whose details you want to access.

You can also define a key value map that lets you create and manage collections of arbitrary key value pairs and ensure that whenever a call is made to your API, thereâ€™s a certificate attached to it that confirms the identity of the caller.
