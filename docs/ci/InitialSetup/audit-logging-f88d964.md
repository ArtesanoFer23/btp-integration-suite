# Audit Logging

Audit log features are different in both environments:

-   In the Cloud Foundry environment, you can use SAP Audit Log service as described under [Audit Logging in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/f92c86ab11f6474ea5579d839051c334.html).

-   In the Neo environment, you can use the audit log retrieval API as described under [Audit Logging in the Neo Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/02c39712c1064c96b37c1ea5bc9420dc.html).

    Additionally, you can use the Cloud Integration *Monitor* application to find audit log information. Choose a tile in section *Access Logs* \(see [Access Logs, Neo Environment](../Operations/access-logs-neo-environment-d5a4113.md)\).
