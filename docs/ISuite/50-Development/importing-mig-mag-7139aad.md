<a name="loio7139aadbf374431aa626a4003c94c72e__section_ykz_zgd_4tb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Login to your application and choose Message Implementation Guidelines <span class="SAP-icons">î‚…</span> or Mapping Guidelines:open_book: from the left pane.

2.  In the overview page, choose *Import*.
3.  In the import dialog box, choose *Browse* to upload the MIG/MAG file that you have exported previously from another tenant.

    > ### Note:  
    > Upload file in `.zip` format.

4.  Choose *Check* to validate your uploaded file.

    The results will display the MIGs/MAGs along with the validation check details. To view the details of the validation, select the icon displayed under the *Check Result* column.

5.  Select the checkbox for those MIGs/MAGs from the list that you wish to import.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the zip file that you are trying to import contains many MIGs/MAGs, the processing might not be able to import all of the content at once which could result in an error. In such cases, try after some time to import the same zip file again. This time, the application will recognize the content that was already imported and only proceed with the import of the missing content.

    You can only select a MIG/MAG which has passed the validation check.

6.  Choose *Import*.
7.  The resulting screen displays the detail of the MIGs/MAGs import. To view more information on the import, select the icon displayed under the *Import Result* column.
8.  Choose *Close*.

    You can now view the imported MIGs/MAGs in the overview screen.
