# Using Predefined Integration Content

SAP Cloud Integration allows the participating organizations to develop, deploy, and consume services in a standardized manner. SAP provides a predefined set of integration content that covers most of the integration needs for a particular scenario. Customers can use the predefined integration content to implement their integration scenarios with less time and effort. To accomplish this, however, customers need to register with SAP Cloud Integration and complete the onboarding process as recommended by SAP.

Customers can re-use existing on-premise content \(message mappings / operation mappings / XSLT based mappings\) from an SAP Enterprise Services Repository \(EHP 1 for SAP NetWeaver 7.3\).
