# Unlocking Integration Packages and Artifacts

When you edit an integration package or an artifact, it is locked and cannot be edited by other users simultaneously. In case you close your browser without saving the changes or there is a session timeout, the package or artifact remains locked, until you unlock it.



## Unlocking Packages or Artifacts Locked by You

1.  Choose *Design* \> *Integrations and APIs*, and select the locked integration package or artifact.
2.  Choose *Edit*.
3.  Select *Yes* when you are prompted to close the previous session.

    The package or artifact is now unlocked and you can continue editing it.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the browser is closed accidently or the session times out before you could save your changes, the unsaved changes will be lost.

## Unlocking Packages or Artifacts Locked by Another User

If the integration package or artifact you want to edit is locked by another user, either request the other user or reach out to your tenant administrator to get them unlocked. For more information, see [Designtime Artifact Locks](designtime-artifact-locks-5b3ecb8.md).
