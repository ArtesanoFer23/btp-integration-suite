# Enabling Key Users

The creation and activation of business data graphs is managed by a user with a special role, called the Graph key user.

The administrator must assign this role to one or more users so that they can create and activate business data graphs for a landscape.

The key user uses Graph on the Integration Suite home page to configure a business data graph. After activating Graph as a capability of API Management within SAP Integration Suite, the role of `Graph_Key_User` must be assigned to a role collection in the SAP BTP cockpit.
