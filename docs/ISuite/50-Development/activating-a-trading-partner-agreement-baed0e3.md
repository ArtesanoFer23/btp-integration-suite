# Activating a Trading Partner Agreement

1.  Navigate to *Agreements* tab.

2.  Search for and open the agreement that you want to activate.
3.  Choose *Activate*.

    > ### Note:  
    > This will activate your agreement and send the agreement details to the partner directory.
    > 
    > If the activation fails, choose the *Failed* status to know more about the activation failure.
