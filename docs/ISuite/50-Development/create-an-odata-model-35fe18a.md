You can create an OData model in SAP Cloud Integration by:

-   Importing from a data source
-   Editing a model from the ground up

Cloud Integration gives you the flexibility to create an OData model in an iterative fashion. For example, you can create an OData model by importing the model definition from a SOAP WSDL file. You can add to this OData model by editing it. Or, you can add to the model definition by importing from a different WSDL file or even a different data source, for example, an EDMX file.
