# Migrating an Agreement

Migrate an agreement that has an outdated format to the latest format.



## Context

Agreements now have a latest format that allows them to choose between two different creation modes. These creation modes - Copy and Reference enable easy maintenance of agreements and are introduced in alignment with the latest agreement template format. If you have any agreements that were created before this format, you need to migrate them to the latest format to continue editing or copying. To do so, follow the procedure below:



## Procedure

1.  Login to your application and navigate to the *Agreements* tab.

2.  Select the agreement that you want to migrate. Agreements with outdated format will have the *Outdated Format* label under their name.

3.  Once the agreement is open, select *Migrate*. In the *Confirm Migration* dialog box, choose *Confirm*. This will migrate the agreement to the latest format. You can now start editing the agreement.
