# Apply the Highest Security Standards

When using SAP Integration Suite , customer data is processed beyond the boundaries of the customer's network. There are various measures taken by SAP to make sure that such data is protected at a maximum level.

However, a significant part of the responsibility also lies with the integration developer. The integration flow ultimately specifies how a message is processed and which options are applied to protect the content of the messages on the way between the sender and the receiver. Therefore, the integration developer has to make sure that the integration flows are designed in a way that ensures that the highest security standards are applied.

> ### Note:  
> You can find the example integration flows that illustrate the guidelines explained in this section in the following integration package published on SAP API Business Hub:
> 
> [Integration Flow Design Guidelines - Apply Highest Security Standards](https://api.sap.com/package/DesignGuidelinesApplySecurity?section=Overview) 
> 
> For more information, see [Copying the Integration Package and Deploying the Integration Flows](copying-the-integration-package-and-deploying-the-integration-flows-2cb1d31.md).

> ### Note:  
> If you don't consider the proposed guidelines during integration design, there's the risk that your scenario is affected in the following way:
> 
> -   Your scenario is exposed to a higher risk for attacks.
> 
> -   Third parties can get access to sensitive data.

To apply this design guideline, consider the following rules:
