Get started with integration flow design, starting with a set of 3 simple integration flows showing basic features of message processing \(with increasing complexity\).

> ### Note:  
> For more information, try out the tutorial [Getting Started with Integration Flow Design Guidelines - Timer Initiated Scenario](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-integration-suite-design-guidelines.html).

To get started, consider the following variants:

-   [Variant: Timer-Initiated Scenario](variant-timer-initiated-scenario-423730f.md)

-   [Variant: Timer-Initiated Scenario with External Data Source and Receiver](variant-timer-initiated-scenario-with-external-data-source-and-receiver-7e766dd.md)

-   [Variant: Sender-Initiated Scenario with External Data Source and Receiver](variant-sender-initiated-scenario-with-external-data-source-and-receiver-36a61b5.md)
