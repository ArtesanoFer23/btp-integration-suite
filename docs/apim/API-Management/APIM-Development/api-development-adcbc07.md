# API Development

API Management provides **one experience** for managing and monitoring all APIs across various data platforms and is enriched with real-time analytics.

API Management enables consumers to access relevant data directly in a secure manner. Selective data can be exposed while reducing the risk of security breaches. App devlopers access APIs created using API Management rather than app consuming services directly. API Management maps a publicly available HTTP endpoint to backend services and handles the security and authorizations required to protect, analyze, and monitor your services.

The following table lists the tasks that an Application Developer, Application Consumer and an API Administrator can perform:
