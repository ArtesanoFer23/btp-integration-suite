# Updating a Key Pair with a Signing Response

Upload a signing response from a certification authority and use it to update the key pair in your keystore, keeping the alias of the keystore entry unchanged.

## Prerequisites

You have created a certificate signing request \(CSR\) for the key pair and used this to request a signed certificate from a certification authority \(CA\). The certification authority has provided a signing response.
