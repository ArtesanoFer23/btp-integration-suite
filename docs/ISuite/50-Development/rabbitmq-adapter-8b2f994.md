# RabbitMQ Adapter

Use the RabbitMQ adapter to publish \(receiver\) and consume \(sender\) messages in between RabbitMQ server and SAP Integration Suite .

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-business-accelerator-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

Exchanges, queues and messages can only be monitored by using the RabbitMQ administrator page. Those monitors arenâ€™t integrated into SAP Integration Suite . In SAP Integration Suite , the integration flows using the RabbitMQ adapter are monitored and the messages are sent to or consumed from the RabbitMQ server.
