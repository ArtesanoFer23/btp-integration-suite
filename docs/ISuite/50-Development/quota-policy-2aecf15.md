# Quota Policy

The Quota policy defines the number of request messages an application can submit to an API endpoint over a given period of time.

The period of time can be an hour, a day, or a month and so on. You can apply this policy on the context of request messages.

The Quota policy helps API providers to restrict the number of calls made to an API. For example, you can restrict access to your applications by defining the number of API calls made as 20 per day or 20,000 over a period of 1 week.

See the following video for visual instructions on how to add and configure the Quota policy:

> ### Note:  
> When the quota limit specified in the policy is reached, the subsequent calls to the API proxy are rejected with the response code 429 \( request limit exceeded\). The rejection period lasts until the end of the quota window. Let's illustrate this with the following example:
> 
> The quota window opens at 00:00 \(12 AM\) and ends at 00:05 \(12:05 AM\). Let us assume that the quota allotted is three requests in the specified period of 5 minutes. At 00:03, if the quota limit is reached, the subsequent requests post 00:03 are rejected until the window is reset at 00:05.
