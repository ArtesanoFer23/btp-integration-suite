# Migration Patterns

The migration tooling maps the sender and receiver channels from the source Integrated Configuration Object \(ICO\) to the equivalent supported ones in the SAP Integration Suite. The equivalent sender and receiver channels are populated in the new integration flow. Same is the case with the flow steps and events. With the possible combinations of supported communication channels, events, and flow steps, there are patterns available in the migration tooling. If your ICO can be mapped to one of these patterns, then migration is achievable.
