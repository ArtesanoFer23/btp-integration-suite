# TLS Connectivity Tests

When you've chosen the TLS connection, the test tool checks the following:

> ### Remember:  
> This component or some of its features might not be available in the Cloud Foundry environment. For more information on the limitations, see SAP Note [2752867](https://me.sap.com/notes/2752867).

-   if the receiver \(host\) is reachable for the tenant.
-   if the keystore is deployed correctly and contains those keys that are required for the specified authentication method during TLS handshake.

To perform the TLS connectivity test, you need to specify the following settings:

**TLS Connectivity Test Options**


<table>
<tr>

Description

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Host* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Add the host name of the receiver.

The host name must **not** contain any path or schema, for example, `https://`\). In particular, you must **not** add a URL as the host name.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Port* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Add the port that is to be used for outbound communication.

Standard port is `443`.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Authenticate with Client Certificate* \(optional\)

</td>
<td valign="top">

Choose this option if the client is to be authenticated against the receiver \(server\) during the TLS handshake \(a mutual authentication\).

If you choose this option, you can also specify the key to be used for the test.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Alias* \(only if *Authenticate with Client Certificate* has been chosen\)

</td>
<td valign="top">

Add the alias that identifies the relevant key pair for client certificate authentication.

In case the receiver requires that during the TLS handshake also the tenant \(client\) is authenticated against the receiver \(server\), you can configure the connection test accordingly \(choosing the *Authenticate with Client Certificate* option\).

In that case, add the *Alias* \(to indicate which key is to be used from the tenant keystore\).

For the tenant to be able to authenticate itself as the client against the receiver, a suitable key has to be available in the deployed keystore.

With the *Alias* field, you can narrow down further the check that a specific key is being used \(for example, a key that matches the configuration settings in the corresponding adapter\).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Include new SAP Key* \(only if *Authenticate with Client Certificate* has been chosen\)

</td>
<td valign="top">

Choosing *Include new SAP Key* allows you to execute the connectivity test with the new key pair from the *New SAP Keys* keystore.

Using this option, you can test the backend connectivity before activating the new SAP key.

For further information, see: [Activating a New Key Pair Provided by SAP](https://help.sap.com/docs/CLOUD_INTEGRATION/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/383be7ad9c8840e38facf9323619907b.html?version=Cloud&q=new%20sap%20key).

> ### Note:  
> The connectivity test checks if the TLS handshake uses the key certificate pair. However, it doesn't validate any authorizations in the target system.
> 
> If *Include new SAP Key* is selected and the specified certificate is not available in the *New SAP Keys* keystore, the system uses the certificate from the *Current* keystore as fallback option.

*Validate Server Certificate Required* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Allows you to validate the server certificate.

When you've chosen the *Validate Server Certificate Required* option \(which is the default setting\), the following checks are executed:

-   If the server certificate belongs to the server the client connects to.

-   If the certificate is signed by an instance the client trusts.


If it wasn't successful and there's an error message, you can unselect the *Validate Server Certificate Required* option.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

If the connectivity test was successful, you get the information about the different checks chosen when sending the request. Afterwards, the `Server Certificates` are displayed with the additional option to download the certificate chain or to add the root CA certificate directly to the tenant keystore.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Add to keystore* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

The *Add to keystore* option is only available if the server response contains a valid root CA certificate.If you use this option, you can directly upload the roor CA certificate to your tenant's keystore.

> ### Note:  
> If the server response does not contain the entire certificate chain, the *Add to keystore* option is not available.

To establish the trust relation to the server, the missing intermediate certificates, as well as the root CA certificates must be available in the tenant keystore. If the intermediate certificates \(there can be more than one\) or the root CA certificate are missing, you have to get these certificates yourself and upload them to the tenant keystore.

For additional information about Certificate Chains, see: [Certificate Chains](../ConnectionSetup/certificate-chains-77a6094.md)

> ### Caution:  
> If you add a certificate to the keystore via *Add to keystore*, this certificate is a trusted certificate for the SAP Cloud Integration system, which means that it trusts any server certificate signed by this certificate. Make sure that you only add certificates from a trustworthy source and check the fingerprint that is displayed in the ensuing dialog.
