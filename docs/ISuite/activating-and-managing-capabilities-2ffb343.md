# Activating and Managing Capabilities

Activate capabilities for the SAP Integration Suite.



<a name="loio2ffb343c163c48a4b3a90f9f3c487328__prereq_ydy_lxj_dmb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have access to the Integration Suite home page. See [Working with Integration Suite Home](20-Working_with_SAP_Integration_Suite_Home/working-with-integration-suite-home-a53dce3.md).
-   You have the Integration\_Provisioner role assigned to your user. See [Subscribing and Configuring Initial Access to SAP Integration Suite](10-InitialSetup/subscribing-and-configuring-initial-access-to-sap-integration-suite-8a3c8b7.md).

## Context

This topic describes how to add and activate relevant capabilities in Integration Suite. The following capabilities are available:

-   Cloud Integration

-   API Management

    -   Graph

-   Open Connectors

-   Integration Advisor

-   Trading Partner Management

-   Integration Assessment

-   Migration Assessment




## Procedure

1.  On the Integration Suite home page, under the *Capabilities* section, choose either *Add Capabilities* \(if it's your first time accessing the Integration Suite home page\) or <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î†¤</span> *Manage Capabilities*.

2.  On the *Activate Capabilities* screen, under *Select Capabilities*, select the relevant capabilities as shown in the following table and choose *Next* to configure additional functionality for individual capabilities.

    *Build Integration Scenarios*

    > ### Note:  
    > -   Select the environment based on your operational needs:
    > 
    >     -   *Non-Production* for non-critical business activities like performance testing, testing new integration scenarios.
    >     -   *Production* for critical business activities.
    > 
    >     > ### Recommendation:  
    >     > If you want to activate both API Management and Cloud Integration capabilities within the same tenant, select the same environment for both capabilities. Once you have activated API Management capability, you can set the same environment by using the *Account Type* field on the *Configure the API Management Service* screen. See [Enable API Management Capability](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/enabling-api-management-capability-from-integration-suite).
    > 
    > -   To support the usage of Java Message Service \(JMS\) queues as temporary storage, select Message Queues. Using JMS message queues allow you to configure asynchronous decoupling of sender and receiver message processing to ensure that in case of an error a retry is done from SAP Integration Suite rather than the sender system. You can use the tenant to manage these queues. See [Managing Message Queues](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/cdcce24f484a41c08ab46d12ab666451.html).

3.  Choose *Activate*.

    > ### Note:  
    > -   If you face any issues during activation or the activation fails, then refer SAP Note [2904202](https://me.sap.com/notes/2904202) and proceed accordingly.
    > 
    > -   After activating Cloud Integration, create a service broker instance. See [Creating Service Instances](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/883f025c30a64373b4e4102238a39fd4.html).
    > 
    > -   You can choose *Add Capabilities* to activate additional capabilities at a later point in time.
    > 
    > -   After activation, assign the required roles to users for accessing the individual capabilities. See [Configuring User Access](configuring-user-access-2c6214a.md).

## Results

-   Capabilities are displayed on the home page as tiles. To access the functionalities offered by these capabilities, users must have the required roles assigned. See [Configuring User Access](configuring-user-access-2c6214a.md).
-   The API Management capability needs a few more configuration steps before activation. See [Additional Configurations for API Management](additional-configurations-for-api-management-5ac63ab.md).
