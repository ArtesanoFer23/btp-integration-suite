# Migrating API Management from Neo to Cloud Foundry Environment

Choose to migrate an existing API Management subscription that you have in the Neo environment to another API Management subscription in the public cloud infrastructures \(hyperscalers\) within the Cloud Foundry environment.



Migration Assistant for asset migration includes the tools and utilities that enable migration of design time assets nondisruptively from the Neo to the Cloud Foundry environment.

Your source system is the system that has your API Management subscription in the Neo environment.

Your target system is the system that has your API Management subscription on the hyperscalers-managed infrastructure within the Cloud Foundry environment. Here Cloud Foundry environment can be your native standalone API Management subscription or API Management capability within the Integration Suite.

For the migration assistance, you must have an API Management subscription in a subaccount within the Cloud Foundry environment.

After completing the prerequisites mentioned in the steps below, you can clone your API Management artifacts nondisruptively from the source to the target system. Post cloning, you must complete some user actions and validate your target system.

> ### Note:  
> The Developer portal is renamed to API business hub enterprise in Cloud Foundry environment. In this document API business hub enterprise is referred to as Developer portal even in Cloud Foundry environment.

The steps assisting the migration of your API Management from your source system to a target system are:

1.  [Prerequisites](prerequisites-c1904bc.md)
