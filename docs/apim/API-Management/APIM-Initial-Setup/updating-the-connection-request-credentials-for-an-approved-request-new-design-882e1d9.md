## Context

To establish the connection between the API portal and the API business hub enterprise, the client Id and client secret created for the API portal is shared during the connection request process.

If you encounter one of the following situations after the connection request has already been approved by the API business hub enterprise admin, you have to update the credentials:

-   The service instance, or the service key gets deleted after the connection between the API portal and the API business hub enterprise was established. In this case, the credentials you were using before the service instance or the service key got deleted becomes invalid.

-   Similarly, if the destination that fetches the API content from the API portal workspace gets deleted, the credentials you were using before the destination got deleted becomes invalid.
