# Predefined Integration Flows for Create and Read Operations

![](images/Predefined_iFlow_-_Create_and_Read_66f3d10.png)

This integration flow is autogenerated for Create and Read operations. In order to complete the binding to the data source, you have to edit at least the following elements:

-   Request Mapping
-   Response Mapping

To understand this integration flow, let's look at an example for the Create operation.



You open an app on your smartphone to book a hotel room in the city of New York. This application sends the booking information to a hotel booking system. The hotel booking system receives this data with the help of a SOAP Web service, stores it, and sends the booking status back to you.

The mobile application communicates with the hotel booking system by calling a URI to create a booking record and passes the booking information as the payload. When the OData sender receives the request, it passes it to the Request Mapping element. This mapping element contains information that maps the fields from the OData structure to the SOAP structure and passes the create request to the SOAP receiver.

The SOAP receiver processes the request and creates a booking record in the back end. If the operation is successful, it returns the status to the Response Mapping element. The Response Mapping element contains information that maps the fields from the SOAP structure to the OData structure. It passes the booking status and other mapped details such as the confirmation number to the OData sender. OData sender in turn passes the response to the mobile application.
