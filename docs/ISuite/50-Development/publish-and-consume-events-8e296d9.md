## Advanced Message Queuing Protocol \(AMQP\) 1.0 over WebSocket

The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol \(AMQP\) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations. It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits onward the instructions that achieve their goals. Event Mesh supports the use of AMQP 1.0 over websocket for messaging between applications.

Refer to the [Specifications for AMQP 1.0 over Websocket](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp-bindmap/amqp-wsb/v1.0/amqp-wsb-v1.0.html) to publish and consume messages.

Also, refer to the [protocal implementation for AMQP 1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/xb-msg-amqp-v100) that SAP provides.
