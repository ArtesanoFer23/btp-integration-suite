# Configure the Dropbox Receiver Adapter

The Dropbox receiver adapter enables SAP Integration Suite to write files and folders to the Dropbox storage.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-business-accelerator-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

> ### Note:
