# Configuring Inbound HTTP Connections

Set up secure HTTP connections to enable:

-   Sender systems to call integration flow endpoints \(through one of the adapters based on the HTTP protocol like, for example, the HTTPS adapter or the SOAP adapter\)

    See: [Setting Up Inbound HTTP Connections \(Integration Flow Processing\)](setting-up-inbound-http-connections-integration-flow-processing-0f92842.md)

-   API clients to call the Cloud Integration OData API

    See: [Setting Up Inbound HTTP Connections \(for API Clients\)](setting-up-inbound-http-connections-for-api-clients-8db3d51.md)


> ### Note:  
> Systems acting as clients for SAP Cloud Integration endpoints are required to use SNI. See SAP Note [2752867](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2752867).
