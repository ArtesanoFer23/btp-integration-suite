# Post-Exit Mapping

The following figure shows the custom mapping extension in the post-exit integration flow.

Here, the only mapping extension is the addition of the field `AdditionalField` to the target structure.

The custom mapping maps the `supplierSurname` field of the source message to the new field `AdditionalField` and applies a simple function \(changing uppercase characters to lowercase characters\).
