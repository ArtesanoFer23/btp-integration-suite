# Setting Up Inbound Mail Connections

Using the mail sender adapter, you connect the tenant with an e-mail server so that the tenant can read data from the e-mail server \(in a process referred to as polling\).



In other words, the tenant sends a request to the e-mail server, but the data flow is in the opposite direction, from the e-mail server to the tenant, as illustrated in the figure. The direction of the request is indicated by the arrow next to the *R* notation in the following figure, the direction of the data flow by the direction of the connection arrow.

Using the sender mail adapter, you can connect to mail servers through the following protocols: IMAP, POP3.

The following table lists the options for setting up secure connections for the different protocols. Consider the following table as a connection setup checklist. For a detailed description of the available properties for integration flow design, see the documentation of the individual adapter.
