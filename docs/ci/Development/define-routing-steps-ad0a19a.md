# Define Routing Steps

Message routers enable you to define the message path. You can also perform operations like splitting the message based on configured conditions and routing the split messages to different message paths.

> ### Note:  
> The *Throw Exception* option is selected to set the behavior of the router to respond to error occurrence.
