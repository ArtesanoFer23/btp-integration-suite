## Overview

Select *Monitor*.

Under *Manage Security*, select *PGP Keys*.

A list of public and secret PGP keys is displayed in a table. For each artifact, the following attributes are displayed:

To download public keys, select *Download* \> *Public Keys.*

To download secret keys, select *Download* \> *Secret Keys.*

When downloading secret keys, you need to specify the key passphrase twice.

> ### Note:  
> It is not recommended to download secret keys. If, for certain reasons, you nevertheless need to download secret keys, make sure to use of a sufficiently secure storage location for the downloaded PGP secret keyring file, for example, a password manager.
> 
> Why do you need to apply a passphrase again when downloading secret keys? During upload, all keys are decrypted with the passphrase specified by you. In a next step, behind the scenes, the system re-encrypts the keys with a system-generated passphrase that is not disclosed to the user. This step further increases the protection level of your keys. Due to these additional steps, it is necessary that you apply a passphrase also when downloading secret keys. This passphrase is used to encrypt all keys in the downloaded secret keyring file.
