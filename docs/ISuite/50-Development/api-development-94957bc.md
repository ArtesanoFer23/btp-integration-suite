# API Development

Build an API artifact and deploy it onto an Edge Integration Cell.

> ### Note:  
> This feature and the information is relevant only if you have activated Edge Integration Cell in your SAP Integration Suite tenant. Availability of this feature depends upon the SAP Integration Suite service plan that you use. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Note [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776).

The Edge Integration Cell is a hybrid deployment model that enables you to deploy and run your APIs in your private landscape \(bypassing traffic through a public cloud\).

You can add an API artifact to a package and define the behavior of the API artifact by using policies.
