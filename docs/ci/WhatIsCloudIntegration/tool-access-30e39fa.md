# Tool Access

You can access and manage integration content and operate and monitor integration artifacts and messages at runtime.

The software that implements the process integration capabilities is updated on a regular basis.

In addition to the runtime components, you can use a Web-based application to:

-   Access predefined integration content provided by SAP at SAP Business Accelerator Hub.

-   Design integration flows and other integration artifacts.

    An integration flow allows you to specify how a message is processed by Cloud Integration \(see [Elements of a Cloud-Based Integration Scenario](elements-of-a-cloud-based-integration-scenario-762289a.md) and [Elements of an Integration Flow](../Development/elements-of-an-integration-flow-e49dbee.md)\). You can design integration flows with a graphical editor.

    SAP also provides guidelines for integration flow design \(see: [Integration Flow Design Guidelines](../Development/integration-flow-design-guidelines-6803389.md)\).

    More information: [Developing Integration Content with SAP Cloud Integration](../Development/developing-integration-content-with-sap-cloud-integration-e6b43b4.md)

-   Monitor the processing of messages and check the status of deployed integration artifacts.

    You also manage-related artifacts such as digital keys and certificates.
