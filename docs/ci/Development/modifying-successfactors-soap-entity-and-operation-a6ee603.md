# Modifying SuccessFactors SOAP Entity and Operation



## Prerequisites

-   You're configuring the communication channel that is assigned with the SuccessFactors SOAP adapter.

-   The TrustedCAs from the service provider you're connecting to have been added to the system keystore associated with your HCI account.




## Context

The SuccessFactors SOAP adapter enables you to modify the entity that you're accessing and the operation that you're performing on the entity. You can use this adapter to perform the following operations:

-   Query

-   Insert

-   Update

-   Upsert


You use the following procedure to change the entity and modify the operation for the SuccessFactors SOAP adapter.

## Procedure

1.  If you'ven't added a system with authentication details, choose :heavy_plus_sign: and provide values in the fields, based on the descriptions in the following table. Choose *Connect*.

    4.  If you choose Basic authentication with credential name or OAuth2, provide the name of the credentials that you've deployed in *Security Material* section in Operations View.

    5.  Choose *Connect*.


3.  In the *Entity Selection* dialog, select the entity that you want to access.

4.  In *Operation* dropdown list, choose the operation that you want to perform.

    > ### Note:
