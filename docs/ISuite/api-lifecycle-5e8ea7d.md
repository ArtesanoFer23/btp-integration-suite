# API Lifecycle

The API lifecycle, starts from API planning, creation and implementation by company developers and other API creators and composers, to the consumption of these APIs by other employees, partners or users of the companyâ€™s products and services.

API Management in SAP Integration Suite is used to discover, shape, compose, integrate, manage, and secure APIs in the entire landscape. APIs are ultimately published in the form of a catalog \(developer portal\), and exposed for consumption by developers, who develop multi-experience applications
