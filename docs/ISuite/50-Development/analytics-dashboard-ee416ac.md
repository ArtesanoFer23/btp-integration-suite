# Analytics Dashboard

The analytics dashboard has some common features such as the views you can choose, the time range for which you want to display data, resize charts, and so on.



## Features of the Analytics Dashboard

The following lists common features on the dashboard:

1.  **Views**: The dashboard provides three views:
    -   **Performance View**: Displays the performance-related charts and KPIs, such as API traffic for a specific period of time.
    -   **Error View**: Displays error-related charts and KPIs, such as total number of API errors.
    -   **Custom View**: Displays custom charts that you created by selecting measures, dimension, and chart type.

2.  **Time interval**: Displays data only for the selected period of time. For example, time interval of months, weeks, and so on.
3.  **Resize charts**: Resize charts from small, medium to large.

> ### Note:  
> The values on the chart for a particular dimension are shown only up to a certain threshold. Any values beyond this threshold are grouped together and labelled as **Others**. By default, the threshold value for the charts is set to **25**. If you wish to modify the threshold value for the charts, please create a support ticket. To create a support ticket, see [Request to Modify Threshold Value for Charts](request-to-modify-threshold-value-for-charts-b55f89d.md).
