# Updating the Connection Request Credentials for a Submitted Request \[Classic Design\]

Update the credentials you've used to establish a connection between the Integration Suite API Management tenant and the API business hub enterprise.



<a name="loioeb84854e31d943b490af77cfb218ddbb__prereq_unb_5nc_tpb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   Only the users who submitted the connection request and has the *AuthGroup.APIPortalRegistration* role assigned to themselves can edit the credentials.

-   To update the Integration Suite API Management tenant access credentials, you must first generate it. To generate the credentials from the Integration Suite API Management tenant, you must have the *APIPortal. Administrator* role assigned to you.

    1.  Log in to the Integration Suite.

    2.  Choose the navigation icon on the left and choose *Settings* \> *APIs*.

    3.  Choose the *Connection* tab.

    4.  Choose *Generate Credentials* under *Connect the API Portal to the centralized API Business Hub Enterprise* and *Copy* the Integration Suite API Management tenant access credentials.


    > ### Note:  
    > The client credentials get generated for the *APIPortal .Service.CatalogIntegration* role.


You must also have the *AuthGroup.APIPortalRegistration* role assigned to you.



## Context

The credentials required to access the Integration Suite API Management tenant are shared during the connection request process.

If you encounter one of the following situations when your connection request is in the submitted state, you have to update the credentials:

-   You have submitted incorrect credentials while raising a connection request, and your request is in pending approval or submitted state.

-   You've deleted the service instance, or the service key, after the connection request was submitted. In this case, the credentials you used before deleting the service instance or the service key becomes invalid.


> ### Note:  
> This document describes the classic design of the API business hub enterprise. To view the documentation for the new design, see [Updating the Connection Request Credentials for a Pending Request \[New Design\]](updating-the-connection-request-credentials-for-a-pending-request-new-design-dd37a7b.md).



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the *API Business Hub Enterprise*.

2.  Navigate to the *Manage* tab and choose *Establish API Portal Connectivity with API Business Hub Enterprise* tile.

3.  Go to the *Actions* column of the connection request that you want to edit and choose *Edit Credentials*.

4.  On the *Edit Credentials for <* Integration Suite API Management tenant*Alias Name \>* popup, enter the mandatory *API Portal Access Credentials* that you copied earlier from the Integration Suite API Management tenant.

    Sample credentials:

    ```
    {
      "url": "https://<application name>.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com",
      "tokenurl": "https://<name>.authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token",
      "certurl": "https://xxxxxx.authentication.cert.sap.hana.ondemand.com",
      "certificate": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > The credentials required to establish the connection will be valid for 365 days. Please remember to regenerate them and reestablish the connection within this timeframe. However, any credentials generated prior to February 2024 with a validity of 65 days will remain valid for that specific duration. The 365-day timeframe will apply to all newly generated credentials.

5.  Choose *Save*.
