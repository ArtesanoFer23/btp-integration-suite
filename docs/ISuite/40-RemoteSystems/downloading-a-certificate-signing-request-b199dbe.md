## Context

When a certificate is originally created, it is self-signed. It has to be signed by a certification authority \(CA\) before it can be used for productive scenarios. To get a certificate signed by a CA, you first need to download a certificate signing request \(CSR\) in the Keystore Monitor.

> ### Note:  
> This option is not available for key pairs with the alias id\_dsa or id\_rsa, or SAP key pairs.



## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP Integration Suite *Monitor* application.

2.  Choose the *Keystore* tile in the *Manage Security* section.

3.  On the *Current* tab, select a key pair.

4.  Choose the <span class="SAP-icons">ÓÅö</span> \(Actions\)icon, then select *Download Signing Request*. Alternatively, you can click the key pair alias to open the key pair details, and then choose *Download* \> *Signing Request*.

5.  A file with the name `<alias>.csr` is downloaded.




## Results

You have downloaded a CSR to your computer.
