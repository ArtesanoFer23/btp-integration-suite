## Context

Depending upon the license you hold, you can set up the *API Management, API Portal* capability from the **Integration Suite** launchpad, or you can use the standalone tile for **API Management, API Portal** to subscribe to the API Portal application.

> ### Note:  
> -   You should either have **Integration Suite** subscription or **API Management, API Portal** tile visibility to set up the API Portal application.
> 
> -   If you’re subscribing to the *API Management, API portal* in the Cloud Foundry subaccount, either by using the **Integration Suite** launchpad or the *API Management, API portal* standalone tile, ensure that you don’t have an instance of starter plan created in the same subaccount.
> 
> -   API Management capabilities from Integration Suite and API Management subscriptions can’t coexist in a subaccount.
