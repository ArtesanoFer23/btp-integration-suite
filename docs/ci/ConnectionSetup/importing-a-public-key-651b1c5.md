# Importing a Public Key

You can import public keys provided by your communication partner.



## Context

The administrators of the sender or receiver system provide the public keys that need to be imported into the tenant's PGP Public Keyring.



## Procedure

1.  You obtain the public key from the sender or receiver administrator \(either by e-mail or by download from a key server\).

2.  Start the GPA tool and select the key.

3.  Choose *Import*.

4.  Browse for the key on your local disk and add it to your keyring.

5.  After the import, verify the fingerprint of the imported key.

    This is important because the key could have been tampered with during its transfer from the sender or receiver.

    The fingerprint is displayed in the GPA tool on the *Details* tab.

    One option to verify the correctness of the fingerprint is to contact the sender/receiver administrator by phone or signed e-mail and ask whether the fingerprint is correct.
