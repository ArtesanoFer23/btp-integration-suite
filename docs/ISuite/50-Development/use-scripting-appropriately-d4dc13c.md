## About the Script Step

The Script step type supports the following script languages:

-   Groovy

-   JavaScript


For more information on this feature, see [Define a Local Script Step](define-a-local-script-step-03b32eb.md).

For general guidelines when using the *Script* step, see [General Scripting Guidelines](general-scripting-guidelines-fcbf0f2.md).

For specific integration flow design guidelines when using the *Script* step, see:

-   [Access Secure Parameters in Scripts](access-secure-parameters-in-scripts-fdf4ce3.md)

-   [Access Headers and Properties in Scripts](access-headers-and-properties-in-scripts-6bc5ed1.md)

> ### Note:  
> You can find the example integration flows that illustrate the guidelines explained in this section in the following integration package published on SAP API Business Hub:
> 
> [Integration Flow Design Guidelines - Scripting Guidelines](https://api.sap.com/package/IntegrationFlowDesignGuidelinesScriptingGuidelines/integrationflow)
> 
> For more information, see [Copying the Integration Package and Deploying the Integration Flows](copying-the-integration-package-and-deploying-the-integration-flows-2cb1d31.md).

If you don't consider the proposed guidelines during integration design, there's the risk that your scenario is affected in the following way:

-   The scenario runs into an out of memory situation.

-   It's hard for the integration expert to understand the logic of the integration flow.

-   Your scenario runs into compatibility issues if there are Java upgrades or Cloud Integration updates.

## Script Collection

A script collection is a bundle of scripts which can be used by all the integration artifacts belonging to the same integration package. See [Developing Script and Script Collection](developing-script-and-script-collection-e60f706.md) for information on how to create and use a script collection.

The advantages of using script collections instead of local scripts are:

-   Reuse

-   Reduced Maintenance Efforts

-   Reduce File Size and Memory Usage

-   Avoid Duplicates


The script collection *Scripting – Script Collection* contains the scripts needed by the integration flows in the integration package *Integration Flow Design Guidelines – Scripting Guidelines*. The integration flows explained in the next chapters use references to the corresponding scripts of the collection instead of local scripts. Only the integration flow *Scripting – Mapping Functions* uses a local script, as UDFs in Mappings are not supported yet in script collections.
