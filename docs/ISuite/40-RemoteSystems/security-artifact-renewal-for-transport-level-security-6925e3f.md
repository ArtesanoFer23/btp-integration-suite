[Security Artifact Renewal for SFTP-Based Communication](security-artifact-renewal-for-sftp-based-communication-682ca61.md "Using SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), the basic set up is that an SFTP client is connected to an SFTP server from which the client pulls data or to which the client pushes data. Secure SFTP communication is enabled by the usage of public/private key pairs as well as a trust relationship between client and server implemented by known_hosts files.")
