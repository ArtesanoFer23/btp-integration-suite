<a name="loioa6534737dc7f468f937fafd95964f27a__prereq_nrz_1p1_1gb"/>

## Prerequisites

You are assigned the Administrator role for the global account.



## Context

When your organization has purchased the corresponding license, an e-mail is sent to the SAP S-user ID specified in the contract. The e-mail message contains the link for logging on to the system and the credentials \(user and password\) for the specified SAP S-user ID.

> ### Note:  
> -   If you have not received this e-mail, the most likely reason is that your user ID was not specified in the order form. Check with your internal team who was responsible for signing the contract, and check which e-mail ID or S-user ID was provided to the SAP Account Manager in the order form.
> 
> -   Check with your SAP Account Manager which S-user ID was provided in the order form.
> 
> -   Contact the SAP Customer Success Team [here](https://support.sap.com/en/product/cloud-platform.html).
> 
> -   If you are still facing issues, create a ticket using the component LOD-HCI-PI-OPS-PROV.



## Procedure

1.  Use the link in your welcome e-mail to log on to the SAP BTP cockpit. The global account *Overview* page opens, displaying global account information, including the number of subaccounts and regions in your global account, and service usage information.

2.  Choose the global account provided in your welcome e-mail. As a next step access your subaccounts already created by SAP or create new subaccounts.
