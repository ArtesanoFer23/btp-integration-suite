# Inbound: Message-Level Security With PKCS\#7, XML DigitalSignature



On top of a secure transport channel \(for example, based on HTTPS\), you have the option to implement message-level security capabilities. That way, you can protect the message by applying digital signing or encryption. Asymmetric key technology is used in the following way to implement these features:

**Keys for Message-Level Security**


<table>
<tr>

<th valign="top">

<td valign="top" rowspan="2">

**Private key**

<td valign="top">

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Used by a receiver to decrypt a message \(that has been encrypted by a sender\)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" rowspan="2">

**Public key** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Used by a receiver to verify a message \(signed by a sender\)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Used by a sender to encrypt a message

</td>
</tr>
</table>



In the inbound case, the tenant acts as receiver that either decrypts or verifies a message.



To implement message-level security for the standards PKCS\#7, WS-Security, and XML Digital Signature, you use X.509 certificates \(the same type of certificates as used for HTTPS-based transport-level security\). However, note that different keys are usually used for message-level security and SSL transport-level security. XML Digital Signature supports only the use cases of signing/verifying messages.

## Configuring the Sender

Configure the sender keystore in the following way:

-   Generate a key pair \(and get it signed by a CA\).

-   Import the tenant public key into the sender keystore.




Provide the tenant administrator with the public key \(is used to verify messages sent to the tenant\).



## Configuring the Integration Flow Steps for Message-Level Security

Depending on the desired option, configure the security-related integration flow steps.

-   Configure the **Verifyer** \(PKCS7 or XML Signature Verifyer\) step.

    Specify the *Public Key Aliases* in order to select the relevant keys from the tenant keystore.

-   Configure the **Decryptor** \(PKCS7\) step.

    Make sure that you specify the *Public Key Aliases* for all expected senders \(only if you have specified *Enveloped or Signed and Enveloped Data* or *Signed and Enveloped Data* for *Signatures in PKCS7 Message*\).

    These are the public key aliases corresponding to the private keys \(of the expected senders\) that are used to sign the payload. The public key aliases specified in this step restrict the list of expected senders and, in this way, act as an authorization check.


In general, an alias is a reference to an entry in a keystore. A keystore can contain multiple public keys. You can use a public key alias to refer to and select a specific public key from a keystore.
