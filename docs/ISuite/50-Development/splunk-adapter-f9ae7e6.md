# Splunk Adapter

Use the Splunk adapter to exchange data between Splunk storage and SAP Integration Suite . You can create data at the connected Splunk storage or retrieve data from there. The Splunk adapter connects to a user's Splunk account from SAP Integration Suite and performs different operations as supported by the Splunk APIs.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
