# Predefined Integration Flows for REST

The Cloud Integration Web application sets up predefined integration flows when the CRUDQ \(Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Query\) operations of entity sets and function imports are bound to a REST web service.

This integration flow is autogenerated for all CRUDQ operations when the receiver is a REST service. You can edit the Script elements in order to define the request and response mappings.
