# Python Script

This policy is used to configure the Python Script code to execute within the context of an API proxy.

The Python Script policy allows you to add a custom-built python functionality to your API proxy flow, wherein the functionality you need isn't supported through the existing policies available in API Management.

Jython version 2.5.2 provides the required python language support. You can find the Jython version 2.5.2 libraries in the following link:

`https://www.jython.org/jython-old-sites/docs/index.html`

> ### Note:  
> The third-party libraries you add must be implemented in pure python language only.

A Python policy contains no actual code. Instead, a Python policy references a Python 'resource' and defines the Step in the API flow where the Python script executes. The Python Script resource must always have the .py extension.

You can attach this policy in the following locations: ![](images/Flow_policy_116062b.png)

An example payload for the policy is as follows:

> ### Code Syntax:  
> ```
> <!-- This sample Python Script policy demonstrates how python scripts are executed. -->
> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
> <Script timeLimit="200" async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" xmlns="http://www.sap.com/apimgmt">
>     <IncludeURL>py://dependency_script.py</IncludeURL>
>     <ResourceURL>py://mainscript.py</ResourceURL>
> </Script>
> 
> 
> 
> ```
> 
> An example of a mainscript.py script
> 
> > ### Code Syntax:  
> > ```
> > This is a sample mainscript.py
> > 	x = 1
> > 	if x == 1:
> >  		# indented four spaces
> >     	print "x is 1."
> > ```

The name of the dependency python file must be of type ‘String’.

> ### Note:

You can include multiple dependency python files with additional `IncludeURL` attributes. The scripts are evaluated in the order in which they are listed in the policy.

This error occurs when the `<ResourceURL>` or the `<IncludeURL>` attributes refer to a python file that doesn't exist, resulting in failure of API proxy deployment.

`NoResourceForURL`
