# Outbound: Message-Level Security With PKCS\#7, XML DigitalSignature



On top of a secure transport channel \(for example, based on HTTPS\), you have the option to implement message-level security capabilities. That way, you can protect the message by applying digital signing or encryption. Asymmetric key technology is used in the following way to implement these features:

**Keys for Message-Level Security**

**Private key**

Used by a receiver to decrypt a message \(that has been encrypted by a sender\)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" rowspan="2">

**Public key** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Used by a receiver to verify a message \(signed by a sender\)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Used by a sender to encrypt a message

</td>
</tr>
</table>



In the outbound case, the tenant acts as sender that either encrypts or signs a message.



To implement message-level security for standards PKCS\#7, WS-Security, and XML Digital Signature, you use X.509 certificates \(the same type of certificates as used for HTTPS-based transport-level security\). However, note that different keys are usually used for message-level security and SSL transport-level security. XML Digital Signature supports only use cases for signing and verifying messages.

## Configuring the Receiver

Configure the receiver keystore in the following way:

-   Generate a key pair \(and get it signed by a CA\).

-   Import the tenant public key into the receiver keystore.




Provide the tenant administrator with the public key \(is used to encrypt messages sent to the receiver\).

## Configuring the Integration Flow Steps for Message-Level Security

Depending on the desired option, configure the security-related integration flow steps.

-   Configure the **Encryptor** \(PKCS7\) step.

    Specify the *Public Key Aliases* in order to select the relevant key from the tenant keystore. In case you have selected *Signed and Enveloped Data* \(as *Signatures*\), you also need to specify the *Private Key Alias* to select the relevant private key for signing.

-   Configure the **Signer** \(PKCS7 or XML Digital Signer\) step.

    Make sure that you specify the *Private Key Aliases* to select the desired keys from the keystore.


In general, an alias is a reference to an entry in a keystore. A keystore can contain multiple public keys. You can use an alias to refer to and select a specific key from a keystore \(as shown for the Signer step in the figure below\).
