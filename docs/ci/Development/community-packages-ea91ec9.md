# Community Packages

Community packages are assets created and packaged by the SAP integration community.





### What is Community Package

SAP has a thriving community of integration experts involved in the creation of community packages. Community packages consist of open-source and editable integration content. Licensed by Apache v2.0, these packages are created through user feedback. The integration content of these packages can be readily reused in consulting and commercial projects.



### How do you consume

You can find these community packages in the *Discover* section, identified by the label *Community Package*.

Like other prepackaged packages, you can copy the community packages to the *Design* workspace. This content is also available on the GitHub. For any support, you can raise an issue with the content under the associated GitHub project.



### What does it contain

Each community package contains documents associated with the integration content and the following links:

-   The Apache license, Version 2.0

-   Link to the package on the GitHub repository.

-   Link to the `Contribute.md` document. This document lists the guidelines to contribute and enhance the community content.
