# OData Model Editor Features

The OData Model Editor in the Cloud Integration Web application enables you to write an Entity Data Model XML \(EDMX\). This model serves as metadata for your OData API. OData Model Editor provides you with the following basic features:

-   **Code Assist**: Provides you with code suggestions that help speed up your development time. There are two types of code assist:

    -   Schema-based
    -   Model-based

-   **Autocomplete**: Predicts the code element you are entering based on the pattern of letters entered.


> ### Note:  
> You can use the OData Model Editor to edit and fine-tune your OData model, after you have imported it from a data source. However, we recommend that you keep the overall end-to-end scenario in mind when you edit the model using this tool. The OData Model Editor can only provide **semantic** validations. It cannot validate the correctness of the OData model in the context of the OData provisioning scenario that you are working in.
