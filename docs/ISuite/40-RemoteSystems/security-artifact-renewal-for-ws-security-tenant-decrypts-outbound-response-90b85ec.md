# Security Artifact Renewal for WS-Security \(Tenant Decrypts Outbound Response\)

This use case covers all situations where private keys used by the tenant to decrypt a response message \(from an outbound request\) are changed. The renewal process ensures that the related public encryption key is changed on the side of the receiver of the request \(that sends the response\) so that no downtime is required.

The WS-Security decryptor uses a private key to verify a WS-Security response payload.

The following figure illustrates the communication path for this use case.

1.  Tenant administrator: Creates a new key pair/certificate.
2.  Tenant administrator: Adds the new certificate to the keystore.
3.  Tenant administrator: Provides the receiver administrator with the new certificate and informs the receiver administrator that payloads encrypted with the new key can be sent.
4.  Receiver administrator: Configures receiver system to send payloads encrypted with the new public key/certificate from now on.
5.  Receiver administrator: Removes the old public key/certificate.
6.  Receiver administrator: Informs the tenant administrator that the receiver system sends payloads encrypted with the new key.
7.  Tenant administrator: Removes the old key pair/certificate from the keystore after a certain time period \(which must be at least the guaranteed delivery time\).

    This time period is necessary to make sure that payloads encrypted with the old key are no longer in the system.


The participants have to make sure that old keys are kept for at least 90 days after they have been exchanged for new ones. This is to ensure that messages can still be decrypted with the old keys for a period of time.
