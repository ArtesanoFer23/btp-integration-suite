# Verify API Key

One of the mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to APIs exposed over the internet is to use the verify API key policy.

The verify API key policy enforces verification of the application key in order to access your APIs.

API Management automatically generates API keys on behalf of applications. It enables API providers to view and approve API keys. By applying a policy of the type VerifyApiKey, you can enforce verification of API keys at runtime. This ensures that no application can access a protected API without a valid key.

The only setting required for the VerifyAPIKey is the expected location of the API key. This policy can be attached to request or response stream of the proxy endpoint or target endpoint.

The schema for the Verify API Key policy is as follows:

> ### Note:  
> The below schema is not a working sample payload.

> ### Code Syntax:  
> ```
> <!-- The policy will prevent unauthorized users from call the api, only users with valid app key will be able to access API. The policy expects the api key to be sent as query param with name "key"-->
> 
> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
> <VerifyAPIKey async="true" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" xmlns="http://www.sap.com/apimgmt">
>     <APIKey ref="request.queryparam.key"></APIKey>
> </VerifyAPIKey>
> 
> ```

APIKey\(Mandatory\)



</td>
<td valign="top">

The variable where the API key can be found.

The API key is extracted from the request message by reference to a Flow variable. For example:

`<APIKey ref="request.queryparam.apikey "/>`

If an application is expected to present the API key as the value of an HTTP header named APIKey, then set this value to request.header.APIKey.

The policy populates several different types of flow variables, including:

-   General

-   App

-   Developer

-   Analytics


The following table lists the general flow variables populated by the Verify API Key policy.

These variables are all prefixed by: `verifyapikey.{policy_name}`

For example: `verifyapikey.{policy_name}.client_id`

Following is an example of an error response:

Following is an example of a fault rule:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> <FaultRule name="FailedToResolveAPIKey">
>     <Step>
>         <Name>AM-FailedToResolveAPIKey</Name>
