# Define Process Call



## Context

You can use this step type to invoke a local integration process from the main integration process.

You use local integration processes to keep the size of a process model at a manageable scale. That way, you can break down the main integration process into smaller fragments \(represented by local integration processes\). You combine these fragments to achieve the complete message processing design of your integration flow.



## Procedure

1.  In the palette, choose *Call* \> *Local Call* \> *Process Call*.

2.  Click somewhere inside the *Integration Process* box of the integration flow model.

3.  Choose *Select* to search for the local integration process you like to connect to.

    All local integration processes are listed that are modeled for this integration flow.

4.  Save and deploy the integration flow.
