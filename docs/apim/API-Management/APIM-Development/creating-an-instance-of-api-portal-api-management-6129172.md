## Procedure

1.  Create a service instance for API Management, API portal.

    Follow the steps described in "Creating a Service Instance in the API Management,API portal" section in [API Access Plan for API Portal](../APIM-Initial-Setup/api-access-plan-for-api-portal-24a2c37.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > If you don't see the API Management, API portal instance under the *Instances* tab on the *Instances and Subscription* page, then you must add the entitlement.
    > 
    > To add the entitlement:
    > 
    > 1.  Choose the *Entitlements* tab from the left pane and choose *Configure Entitlements* \> *Add Service Plans*.
    > 
    > 2.  Under *Entitlements available for this subaccount*, select API Management,API portal.
    > 
    > 3.  On the right pane, select the available plans for API Management,API portal and choose *Add \( \) Service Plan*.
    > 
    > 4.  On the *Entitlements* page, choose *Save*.

2.  Create a service key for API portal, API Management.

    Follow the steps described in "Creating a Service Key" section in [API Access Plan for API Portal](../APIM-Initial-Setup/api-access-plan-for-api-portal-24a2c37.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > While configuring JSON, only the *APIportal.Administrator* role must be assigned to you and not the "APIPortal.Guest" and "APIManagement.SelfService.Administrator" roles as mentioned in [API Access Plan for API Portal](../APIM-Initial-Setup/api-access-plan-for-api-portal-24a2c37.md).

    Once the service key is created, make a note of the url, clientid, clientsecret, and token as these details would be needed while creating HTTP destination *APIManagement*. To copy the details, perform the following steps:

    1.  Choose the API portal, API Management service instance that you created recently, to expand the right-pane.

    2.  To view the credentials, choose the *<Service Key Name\>*.

    3.  Choose the *JSON* tab and copy the details.

        > ### Sample Code:  
        > ```
        > {
        > 	"url": "https://<apiportal application name>.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com",
        > 	"tokenUrl": "https://<Space name>.authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token",
        > 	"clientId": "sb-apiaccessxxxxxxxx!xxxx|api-portal-xsuaa!bxxxx",
        > 	"clientSecret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx="
        > }
        > 
        > ```
