# Quota

The Quota policy defines the number of request messages an application can submit to an API endpoint over a given period of time.

The period of time can be an hour, a day, or a month and so on. You can apply this policy on the context of request messages.

The Quota policy helps API providers to restrict the number of calls made to an API. For example, you can restrict access to your applications by defining the number of API calls made as 20 per day or 20,000 over a period of 1 week.

See the following video for visual instructions on how to add and configure the Quota policy:
