## Implementation

SAP Cloud Integration offers a graphical modeling environment in the *Design* section that allows you to design integration flows. This tool provides various capabilities supporting you in increasing the readability of an integration flow.

Align participants to either the left or the right of the integration process. The flow direction must be from left to right and top to bottom. Message flow must be in straight horizontal or vertical lines.
