# Configure the Dropbox Sender Adapter

The Dropbox sender adapter enables an SAP Cloud Integration tenant to receive files from the Dropbox storage.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP API Business Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP API Business Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-api-business-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

> ### Note:  
> The Download archive file will be a part of sender Dropbox adapter only. These files aren't part of the Dropbox receiver adapter.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a third-party web service that is outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your companyâ€™s policies.

    Download a folder from the user's Dropbox account as a zip file.

-   *Download File*

    Download a file from a Dropbox account. It is also supported to download files using wildcards.

</td>
<td valign="top">

Select the action to be performed after successful processing of the file.

-   *Delete File*

    The file is deleted after it has been processed successfully.

-   *Keep File and Process again*

    Keep the file for testing, and reprocess as specified by the scheduler. If you choose this option, the file is processed with every message processing run, even if it has not been changed.

-   *Move File* 

    Move the file to an Archive Directory \(Specified by the user in *Archive Directory* field\).

-   *Keep file and mark as processed in Idempotent repository* \(default\)

    Prevents a file from being consumed twice per integration flow. For that purpose, an idempotent repository \(database\) is activated.


> ### Note:  
> The idempotent repository contains information about files already been consumed from the Dropbox server. It stores the filenames in a database to synchronize between multiple worker nodes and to prevent the files from being read again when the runtime node is restarted. Filename entries are deleted by default after 90 days.
