# Manage Stores for Edge Integration Cell

The *Manage Stores* section allows you to manage various temporary data storages on your selected runtime.

In *Data Stores*, you can store different artifacts relevant for message processing. For more information, see [Managing Data Stores](50-Development/managing-data-stores-ac39f1d.md).

The *Variables* view allows you to monitor variables used in integration flows. For more information, see [Managing Variables](50-Development/managing-variables-ca93653.md).

Since certain adapters allow you to store messages in queues, you can view the messages by choosing *Message Queues*. For more information, see [Managing Message Queues](50-Development/managing-message-queues-cdcce24.md).

> ### Note:  
> You can always switch the runtime in all stores displayed.
