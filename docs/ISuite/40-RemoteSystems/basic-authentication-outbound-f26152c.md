# Basic Authentication \(Outbound\)

Basic authentication uses credentials to allow the identification of trusted communication partners. Credentials are composed of user and password and, in case the SuccessFactors connector is involved, additional attributes. In addition to credentials, basic authentication also uses a one-way SSL connection which requires server certificates. Therefore, security artifact update involves both the update of credentials and of the involved certificates.
