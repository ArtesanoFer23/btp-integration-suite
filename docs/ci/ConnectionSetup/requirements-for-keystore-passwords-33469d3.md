# Requirements for Keystore Passwords

To protect a keystore, you have to specify a password when creating the keystore.

You have to apply the following rules when specifying passwords for keystores:

-   The password must have a minimum length of 8 characters.
-   The password must contain characters of **at least three** of the following groups:
    -   Lower-case Latin characters \(a-z\)
    -   Upper-case Latin characters \(A-Z\)
    -   Base 10 digits \(0-9\)
    -   Non-alphabetic characters \(!@\#$%...\)

-   The password must **not** contain any characters from outside the standard ASCI table like, for example, German umlaut characters \(*<Ã¼\>*\).

> ### Note:  
> Example for password compliant with the above rule:
> 
> *<xB+gku!kjhz\>*
