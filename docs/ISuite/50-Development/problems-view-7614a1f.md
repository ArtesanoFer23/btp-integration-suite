# Problems View

Use this view to see all errors and warnings associated with integration components and resources.

The *Problems* view displays all issues related to integration components and resources occurred during design time. This helps you identify and resolve issues that have an impact during runtime.

The first column in the table displays the *Severity* status of an issue. In the second column, there is a *Description* of the issue. The third column highlights the *Location* of the integration component or resource where the issue was encountered. When you click the location ID, the application redirects you to the affected configuration of the integration component or to the affected resource.

> ### Example:  
> Consider a location is displayed as *SFTP \[Receiver\_1\]*. Here the issue is related to a SFTP receiver adapter. This is identified by noticing the name and ID displayed in brackets, sometimes components may only have ID displayed. You must note that for resources ID's are not displayed.

> ### Note:  
> Content validation issues of resources when edited in their respective editors are not propagated to the Integration Flow.
