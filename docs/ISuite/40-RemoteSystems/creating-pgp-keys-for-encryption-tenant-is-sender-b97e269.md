# Creating PGP Keys for Encryption \(Tenant Is Sender\)



## Prerequisites

You have installed gpg4win, created the tenant-specific directory, and created a key pair.



## Context

For this use case, the following key artifact has to be deployed on the tenant:

A **PGP Public Keyring** that contains the **receiverâ€™s** public key \(required by the tenant to encrypt the payload\)

The following figure shows the required entities to be configured for the tenant \(on the left\).

## Procedure

1.  Obtain the public key from the receiver.

    We recommend using a secure channel to ensure that the information originates from the correct source and that it has not been changed on its way. A signed email would be suitable, for example.

2.  Import the receiver's public key into the PGP Public Keyring.

3.  If a secure channel has not been used to obtain the public key from the receiver, verify the fingerprint of the public key.

    One option is to phone the owner of the public key and compare the fingerprint.




## Next Steps

Deploy the **PGP Public Keyring** on the tenant.

The GPA tool cannot maintain several PGP Secret or Public Keyrings at the same time. Therefore, you have to create a separate directory for each tenant, where you have to configure GPA and the launching of GPA separately (otherwise, keys from different tenants will be stored in the same keyring).")
