# Managing Licence for Type Systems

> ### Note:  
> This procedure is not relevant for SAP Integration Suite users as the licensing of the type systems is provided along with the software subscription.

You can access Integration Advisor when you purchase Enterprise Edition license for SAP Cloud Integration. However, you need to purchase licenses for type systems used in SAP Integration Advisor, like *X12* or *EDIFACT* separately.

You can purchase these type system licenses on the [SAP Store](https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/40109/SAP-Cloud-Platform-Integration%2C-Library-add-ons).

Please update/verify the license you have purchased on SAP store:

1.  Log on to Integration Advisor and access the *Profile* section.
2.  The *Licenses* tab list the type systems and their license information.

    > ### Note:  
    > Choose :arrows_clockwise: to update the license information.


> ### Note:  
> In case of a subaccount move, check for the type system licenses and raise an incident under the component *LOD-HCI-PI-SUG* to move the licenses to your new subaccount.
