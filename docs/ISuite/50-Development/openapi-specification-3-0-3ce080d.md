# OpenAPI Specification 3.0

In addition to supporting OAS 2.0, Integration Suite now supports OpenAPI Specification \(OAS\) 3.0.



Integration Suite supports creation and import of API definitions in Open API Specification\(OAS\) 3.0. These OAS 3.0 API definitions can be created using API designer or existing ones can be imported using SAP Integration Suite import functionality. For the created or imported API definition, API proxy is created on which user can apply policies to bring in SAP Integration Suite capabilities.

To know more about importing APIs, see [Import an API](import-an-api-9342a93.md).

To know more about creating APIs using the API designer, see [Create an API Using the API Designer](create-an-api-using-the-api-designer-26e1bbd.md).
