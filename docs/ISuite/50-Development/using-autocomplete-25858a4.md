# Using Autocomplete



## Context

The autocomplete feature predicts the word you are entering based on the pattern of letters entered and provides you with suggestions. The suggestions are context-sensitive. You can get suggestions for elements, attributes, attribute types, properties, and property values.

Follow this procedure to use the autocomplete feature in the OData Model Editor.



## Procedure

1.  Choose *OData Model Editor* \(<span class="SAP-icons-V5">î†´</span>\) on the Service Designer page. The OData Model Editor page opens.

2.  Place the cursor in the context where you need assistance and start entering letters. Autocomplete suggestions appear next to the letters in context.

3.  Use the [Up arrow\] and [Down arrow\] keys on the keyboard to select the required suggestions and press [Enter\].

    > ### Note:  
    > Use the arrow keys if there is more than one suggestion. If there is only one suggestion, simply press [Enter\].
