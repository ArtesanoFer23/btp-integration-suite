# Renewal of Load Balancer Server Certificate

In this use case, the load balancer server certificate has to be renewed. In the renewal process, the load balancer administrator \(at the site of the cloud infrastructure provider\) and the sender back-end administrator \(at the customer side\) collaborate with each other.

The following figure illustrates the communication path that is relevant for this use case.

> ### Note:  
> It depends on the **operating model** whether the tenant administrator and the integration developer are at the customer or at SAP. In the **customer-managed operating model**, the tenant administrator and integration developer tasks are performed by the customer. In the **SAP-managed operating model**, these tasks are performed by SAP.

Certificate renewal has to be performed in the following sequence.



1.  Load balancer administrator: Creates new key pair/certificate with new CA root certificate.
2.  Load balancer administrator: Informs tenant administrator that virtual server certificate will be exchanged at a certain point in time and forwards new root \(CA\) certificate.
3.  Tenant administrator: Informs sender administrator and forwards the new root certificate to the sender.
4.  Sender administrator: Adds the new root certificate to the truststore of the sender back-end \(HTTPS client\).
5.  Load balancer administrator: Exchanges the load balancer virtual server key pair/certificate at the specified point in time.
6.  Sender administrator: Can now remove the old root certificate form the truststore of the sender back-end \(HTTPS client\) after the specified point in time has passed.
