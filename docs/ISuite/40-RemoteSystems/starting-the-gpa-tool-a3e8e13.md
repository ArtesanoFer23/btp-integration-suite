# Starting the GPA Tool

Start the GPA tool to manage keys.



## Procedure

Double-click the `run_gpa.bat` file in the relevant tenant-specific directory.

If you start GPA without executing `run_gpa.bat`, gpa will use the default GNUPGHOME directory.



## Next Steps

As soon as you have started the GPA tool, the following files are created for the PGP Public Keyring and PGP Secret Keyring: `pubring.gpg` and `secring.gpg` \(see the following screenshot of the tenant-specific directory after tool launch\).

These files have to be deployed later on the tenant as PGP Public Keyring and PGP Secret Keyring.
