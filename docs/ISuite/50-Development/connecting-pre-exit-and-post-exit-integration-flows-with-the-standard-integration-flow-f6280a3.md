# Connecting Pre-Exit and Post-Exit Integration Flows with the Standard Integration Flow

## Connecting Custom Integration Flows with the Standard Integration Flow

To make sure that the standard integration flow and post- and pre-exit integration flows are processed in conjunction as expected, make sure that the ProcessDirect adapter addresses match in the right way.

The ProcessDirect adapter address of the pre-exit integration flow must match the ProcessDirect adapter address in the pre-exit of the standard integration flow.

The same applies for the ProcessDirect adapter address of the post-exit integration flow and the corresponding ProcessDirect adapter address in the post-exit of the standard integration flow.
