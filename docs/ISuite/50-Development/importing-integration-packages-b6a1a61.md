# Importing Integration Packages

Upload your existing integration packages that suits your integration scenario to reduce redundancy and duplication efforts of creating a package from scratch.



## Procedure

1.  Choose *Design* \> *Integrations* \> *Import*.

    Importing a new version of a package \(zip import\) over an existing package doesn't overwrite the configured values of the externalized parameters in the existing package.

2.  Browse and select the integration package for uploading.

3.  Choose *OK*.

    Import of package fails with *Uniqueness Conflict* when the package contains one or more artifacts that already exist in other packages of the tenant.

    A package is created based on the metadata of the uploaded file.
