# AzureStorage Sender Adapter for Table Storage

The AzureStorage sender adapter enables SAP Integration Suite to perform read operations on tables on Azure Storage.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-business-accelerator-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a third-party web service that is outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your companyâ€™s policies.

*Post-Processing* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Select the action to be performed after successful processing of the file:

-   *Keep Entity and Process Again*

    Keeps entity in the storage and reprocesses it as specified by the scheduler. If you choose this option, the entity is processed with every message processing run, even if it hasn't been changed.

-   *Keep Entity and Mark as Processed in Idempotent Repository*

    Prevents entity from being consumed again within the configured duration. For that purpose, an idempotent database is activated with the configured persist duration.

    > ### Note:  
    > The idempotent repository contains information on entities already been consumed from Azure Storage. It stores the entity names in a database to synchronize between multiple worker nodes and to prevent the entities from being read again when the runtime node is restarted. Entity name entries are deleted by default after 90 days.

-   *Delete Entity*

    Entity is deleted from Azure Storage after it has been processed successfully.

</td>
<td valign="top">

Select this option to raise error in the message processing log if post processing fails.

Using this option, if post-processing fails, the message gets *Failed* status. Otherwise, the message gets status *Successful*. In both cases, the post-processing operation status is stored in message property log.

-   If post-processing operation fails and *Move Blob* is selected, status is stored in property `SAP_AzureStorage_Move_Response`.

-   If post-processing operation fails and *Delete Blob* is selected, status is stored in property `SAP_Azurestorage_Delete_Response`.

-   If post-processing operation fails and *Keep Blob and Mark as Processed in Idempotent Repository* is selected, status is stored in property `SAP_Azurestorage_Keepfile_Response`.
