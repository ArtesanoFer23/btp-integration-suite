## Context

To establish the connection between the API portal and the API business hub enterprise, the API Portal client Id and the client secret is shared during the connection request process.

If you encounter one of the following situations when your connection request is in the submitted state, you have to update the credentials:

-   You have submitted incorrect credentials while raising a connection request, and your request is in pending approval or submitted state.

-   You've deleted the service instance, or the service key, after the connection request was submitted. In this case, the credentials you used before deleting the service instance or the service key becomes invalid.




## Procedure

1.  Log on to the *API Business Hub Enterprise*.

2.  Navigate to the *Manage* tab and choose *Establish API Portal Connectivity with API Business Hub Enterprise* tile.

3.  Go to the *Actions* column of the connection request that you want to edit and choose *Edit Credentials*.

4.  On the *Edit Credentials for <API Portal Alias Name \>* popup, enter the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* that you copied earlier from the API Portal.

    Sample credentials:

    ```
    {
      "url": "https://<application name>.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com",
      "tokenUrl": "https://<name>.authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token",
      "clientId": "sb-apiaccessxxxxxxxx!xxxx|api-portal-xsuaa!bxxxx",
