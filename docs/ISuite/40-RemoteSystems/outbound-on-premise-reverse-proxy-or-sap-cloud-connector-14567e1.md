# Outbound/On-Premise: Reverse Proxy or SAP Cloud Connector

When you connect an on-premise \(receiver\) system to the integration platform, you need to interconnect either a reverse proxy or an SAP Cloud Connector between the on-premise system and the integration platform in the SAP Cloud.



## Overview

To decide which option is the best one for your use case, refer to the following table.

**Decision Matrix: Reverse Proxy versus SAP Cloud Connector**

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Existing reverse proxy and demilitarized zone \(DMZ\) infrastructure can be reused for cloud scenarios: No additional components need to be operated on-premise.



</td>
<td valign="top">

-   No inbound ports pointing to the on-premise network need to be opened.

-   Firewall and DMZ remain unchanged \(for example, no additional IP white-listing\).

-   Direct attacks \(for example, DDOS\) from the Internet are not possible.

IT-based, centralized approach with more re-use potential, independent of SAP BTP cockpit or Cloud Integration infrastructure

Additional capabilities might be provided by the reverse proxy \(load balancing, application gateway, rules, and so forth, depending on the used product\).

## Decision Graph

To decide whether to use a reverse proxy or SAP Cloud Connector, you can follow the decision graph as outlined in the following figure and described further below.

![](images/Decision_Graph_eb6ecd7.png)

1.  Independent of your current IT infrastructure setup, you want to give the control for introduction of SAP connectivity service to the line of business \(LOB\) - for example, because of timing, or special solution in a subsidiary or segment.

    -   Yes: Use SAP Cloud Connector.

    -   No: Go to next question.


2.  Need identity provider federation?

    For example, users are managed via on-premise ldap servers like Microsoft Active Directory.

    -   You need SAP Cloud Connector anyway. In this case it can be used as reverse proxy, too.

    -   No: Go to next question.


3.  Have a reverse proxy in place connected to the required application systems?

    -   Use reverse proxy, add SAP BTP cockpit IP range for white-listing, use SSL/TLS, apply your IT standards.

    -   No: Go to next question.


4.  Have a reverse proxy in place, but not connected to the application systems needed yet?

    -   Add application systems to reverse proxy and use it.

    -   No: Go to next question.


5.  Want to start a general investment into a reverse proxy infrastructure?

    -   Purchase a reverse proxy and introduce it by IT.

        > ### Caution:  
        > This might be a project with several months of execution time.

    -   No: Use SAP Cloud Connector.
