# Consume API Proxies

Consume API proxies via the API business hub enterprise. In the API business hub enterprise, an application developer registers, explores the API exposed by customers, creates applications, and tests API proxies.

> ### Caution:  
> Effective June 2024, the classic design of the API business hub enterprise will be deprecated and will no longer be accessible. The new design of the API business hub enterprise will be set as your default design from March 2024. For more information, see [Configure API business hub enterprise](configure-api-business-hub-enterprise-54b4607.md).

If you've added API business hub enterprise as a capability with Integration suite, or if you’ve subscribed to the API business hub enterprise as part of the standalone API Management subscription, you have the option to experience the new design of the API business hub enterprise user interface along with the classic design.

When you login for the very first time, you’ll still see the classic design of the API business hub enterprise. However, you can use the toggle switch to view the new design. At this point of time, only the Site Administrator can use the toggle switch.

> ### Note:  
> By default, the Site Administrator has an option to switch from classic to new design and set the new design as the default UI using the **Site Editor.** The Site Administrator has the right to enable the configuration to let all the other users switch between the old and the new design. For more information, see [Customize the Visual Format of the API business hub enterprise](customize-the-visual-format-of-the-api-business-hub-enterprise-2eacd52.md).

API business hub enterprise is an application that provides a common platform for Application developers to consume API proxies. Every API Management customer is provided with their own API business hub enterprise application on cloud. The API business hub enterprise offers capabilities to onboard application developers, explore and test API proxies, create and subscribe to Applications.

The API business hub enterprise supports the following features:

-   **Onboard an Application developer**- To explore the API proxies and subscribe to an Application, an Application developer must be registered to the API business hub enterprise. On registering, the Application developer is provided access to the API business hub enterprise.
-   **Browse Catalog**- Explore the Products \(assembled APIs\) available in the Catalog store, navigate to individual API proxies, read the API Documentation, and view the resources attached to the API proxies.
-   **Create Applications** – An Application developer can create on or more applications to consume API proxies. To consume the API proxies, an Application developer must subscribe to an Application \(assembled Products\). It is by subscribing to an Application that you return to the developer the key required to access the API proxies.
-   **Download JSON**- You can download the open API specification for the APIs that are part of the API business hub enterprise in JSON format. This enables the developer to use the metadata of the APIs for various aspects such as code/SDK generation for developing applications.

-   **Download SDK**- You can also download the client software development kit \(SDK\) for developers through a non-commercial license on open source sites. You can use this SDK for developing applications.

-   **Test API Proxies** - You can test the API proxies and understand the runtime behavior of the API proxies better. Use the Test Console to explore the resources associated with an API and execute the operations.
