Use the Slack adapter to exchange data between Slack storage and SAP Integration Suite . You can create data at the connected Slack storage or retrieve data from there. The Slack adapter connects to a user's Slack account from SAP Integration Suite and performs different operations as supported by the Slack APIs.
