# Verifying Access for Users

Verify whether all the users that you have added to the subaccount have access to the SAP Cloud Integration application.



## Procedure

1.  Launch the URL *https://xxxxx-tmn.hci.sa1.hana.ondemand.com/itspaces* that you will find in the welcome e-mail in a browser \(Internet Explorer or Google Chrome\).

2.  Enter your S-user or P-user ID and password to log on to the application.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you are unable to verify access, perform the following steps:
    > 
    > If you get an authentication error or any other issues, please check that you have assigned the right role to the S- or P-user that you are verifying access for.
    > 
    > If you get an *Access Denied* error even though you have correctly assigned the required user roles, please check the SSO certificates in your browser. The browser might be using another user for the SSO logon instead of the S-user that you defined in the roles and authorizations.
    > 
    > If you are still facing issues, create a ticket using the component LOD-HCI-PI-OP-SRV. The SAP Cloud Operations team will look into the issue and provide a solution.
