You have created an OData model either by importing from a data source or by editing the model manually using the Cloud Integration Web application.

You can use this procedure to view the overall layout of an OData model in the Graphical Model Viewer. This helps you verify the OData model and determine if any additional changes are necessary.



## Procedure

1.  Choose *Graphical Model Viewer* \(<span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span>\) on the Service Designer page. The OData model is rendered in a graphical format.

    You can use the navigation control and viewing options to customize your viewing preferences. For more information, see [Graphical Model Viewer Features](graphical-model-viewer-features-a53aeed.md).

2.  Choose *Back* \(<span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span>\) to get back to the Service Designer page.
