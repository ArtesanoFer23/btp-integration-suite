# Import Integration Adapters

Import and auto-deploy the adapters that are published in the SAP API Business Hub in your design workspace.



## Procedure

1.  In the Integration Flow Editor, do one of the following based on your requirement:

    1.  Choose *Sender*, select the connector, and drag to *Start*.

    2.  Choose *End*, select the connector, and drag to *Receiver*.


2.  In the *Adapter Type* dialog, select the adapter that you want to assign.

    You see a list that includes both preshipped adapters and the ones from SAP API Business Hub. Though you haven't imported adapters from SAP API Business Hub, Cloud Integration shows you all the adapters that are available from the Hub.

    If you select an adapter from SAP API Business Hub, Cloud Integration automatically imports the adapter and its package to your design workspace, and deploys the adapter for consumption across your tenant.

3.  Save or deploy your changes after configuring the adapter. See [Configure Adapter in Communication Channels](configure-adapter-in-communication-channels-1f06633.md).
