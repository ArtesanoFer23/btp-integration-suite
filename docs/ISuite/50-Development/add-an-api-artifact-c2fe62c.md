# Add an API Artifact

Add an API artifact to an package.



<a name="loioc2fe62c32855435f8b64e0fd10c8507e__prereq_qtk_13k_qwb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   Enable Cloud Integration and API Management capabilities.

-   Provision Edge Integration Cell runtime.




## Context

You can design and deploy API artifacts along with Integration flows.

When you create an API artifact of the type REST and SOAP you can choose from the following options:

-   *URL*: Create an API artifact using the HTTP endpoint UR. For more information, see [Create an API Artifact Using URL](create-an-api-artifact-using-url-914f57e.md).

-   *Import*: Import an API definition and use it to build your API \(supported file types:.json, .yaml, and .zip\). For more information, see [Create an API Using an Imported API Definition](create-an-api-using-an-imported-api-definition-fb99a7d.md).

-   *API Specification*: Create an API artifact from a specification which contains the single target URL endpoint. For more information, see [Create an API Using API Specification](create-an-api-using-api-specification-39c2b30.md).
