# SuccessFactors OData V4 Receiver Adapter

The SuccessFactors receiver adapter enables you to communicate with the SuccessFactors system. You use the OData V4 message protocol to connect to the OData V4-based Web services of the SuccessFactors system.

> ### Tip:  
> -   If your input payload has nodes without data, the output also has empty strings. If you want to avoid empty strings in the output, ensure that the input payload doesn’t contain any empty nodes.
> -   You can use headers and exchange properties in the adapter settings to pass values dynamically during runtime. More information: [Headers and Exchange Properties Provided by the Integration Framework](headers-and-exchange-properties-provided-by-the-integration-framework-d0fcb09.md).

Once you’ve created a receiver channel and selected the SuccessFactors OData V4 receiver adapter, you can configure the following attributes. See [Overview of Integration Flow Editor](overview-of-integration-flow-editor-db10beb.md).

> ### Note:  
> The adapter only supports SuccessFactors Learning Management System \(LMS\) OData V4 entities.
