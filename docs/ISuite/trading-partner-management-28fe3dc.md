# Trading Partner Management

SAP Trading Partner Management \(TPM\) is a microservice that meets the needs of your B2B data exchange such as individual definition and configuration of specific electronic exchange of business data between you and your trading partners. B2B users have different levels of requirements for data exchange starting from the different kind of communication protocols such as AS2, SFTP, etc. to the usage of different types of B2B standards or APIs. TPM helps you manage B2B relationships with multiple trading partners. The easy-to-use user interface helps you cope with the complexity of B2B communication between trading partners.

TPM, just like Cloud Integration and Integration Advisor, is a capability of SAP Integration Suite. This application achieves the goal by using the entities and artifacts provided by the other capabilities of SAP Integration Suite such as:

-   SAP Integration Advisor

-   SAP Cloud Integration

## Features

The application helps you to:

-   Create and maintain trading partner profiles with their B2B requirements. This includes creating the profile of own company with all relevant information for setting up B2B scenarios such as contact person, identifiers, communication protocol and its parameters, and B2B standards.

-   Create communication partner profile to maintain all your AS2 specific configurations.
-   Develop templates for trading partner agreements based on the requirements of your B2B scenarios.
-   Create trading partner agreements using the templates and also including the requirements of the trading partners.
-   Push the auto-generated runtime artefacts of the B2B scenarios as defined in the agreements into the Partner Directory of SAP Cloud Integration. This will ensure that the B2B messages get processed individually by a single integration flow at runtime.
-   Deploy and run integration flows to conduct end-to-end business transactions.
