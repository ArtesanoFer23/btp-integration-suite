# Variant 2: Splitter Without Gather Without Stop on Exception and with Exception Subprocess

The example integration flow *Handle Errors - Splitter without Stop on Exception* is designed in the following way.

![](images/Handle_Errors_-_Splitter_without_Stop_on_Exception_0e922ee.png)

This example scenario works in the following way:

1.  SAP Cloud Integration receives a composite \(bulk\) message through an HTTPS adapter.

    The bulk message contains multiple orders with multiple items.

2.  The Splitter step divides the bulk message into as many individual messages as there are order items.

    The following settings have been defined for the Splitter step:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Attribute


    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Value


    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Expression Type


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    XPath


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    XPath Expression


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    /ns0:PurchaseOrder/Items/Item


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Grouping


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    1


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Stop on Exception


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    \(Not selected\)


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
3.  The individual messages are processed in a separate Local Integration Process. In the example scenario, a simple message mapping transforms the `Item` node of the source structure to the `Item` node of the target structure.

4.  The single message chunks are sent to the receiver.


Dedicated elements in the integration flow model have dedicated tasks:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Element



</th>
<th valign="top">

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Integration Process: Message Splitter without Stop on Exception*



</td>
<td valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Local Integration Process: Split Process*



</td>
<td valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Exception* \(Receiver shape\)



</td>
<td valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*System* \(Receiver shape\)



</td>
<td valign="top">

Generic Receiver integration flow creating a

Data Store entry to represent the receiver system in success case



</td>
</tr>
</table>

Errors occurring in the split processing are handled in an Exception Subprocess in the Local Integration Process. The Exception Subprocess ends with a Message End event. In case of an error, the split message is written to the data store and is not sent out to the Receiver. The overall processing continues until all splits are executed. The message gets a *Completed* status in the monitoring.  

The splits that caused an error and that are stored in a data store can, for example, be polled by a different integration flow and handled differently.

## Executing the Scenario

To run this scenario, open folder *SplitterWithExceptionSubprocess* of the Postman collection.

Select one of the following requests:

-   *SplitterWithoutStopOnException\_withError*

    To simulate an error situation, run the integration flow with this request. The processing stops because of an invalid price of one of the purchase order items \(in the request payload\). Due to the invalid price, message mapping fails.

    When monitoring the message processing, the integration flow has status *Completed*.

-   *SplitterWithoutStopOnException\_withoutError*

    To simulate successful message processing, run the integration flow with this request.

## Expected Behavior

If message processing is successful, in the Monitor application you find the following entries:

-   5 entries in Data Store *MessageSplitter-successful*

    6 new message processing logs in *Completed* state, 1 for integration flow *Handle Errors - Splitter without Stop on Exception* \(related to the guideline\) and 5 of the *GenericReceiver* integration flow.


In the error case, in the Monitor application you find the following entries:

-   4 entries in Data Store *MessageSplitter-successful* \(items 10, 20, 30, and 50\)

-   1 entry in Data Store *MessageSplitter\_exception* \(item 40\)

-   1 message processing log for integration flow *Handle Errors - Splitter without Stop on Exception* \(related to the guideline\) in *Completed* state

-   5 message processing logs in *Completed* state for the *GenericReceiver* integration flow
