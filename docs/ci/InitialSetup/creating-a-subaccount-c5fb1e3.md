# Creating a Subaccount

Use a subaccount to host applications and services in production or non-production environments.



<a name="loioc5fb1e3210cf485684106b86d7398c1a__prereq_n5f_kvj_5cb"/>

## Prerequisites

You are authorized to access services using the consumption-based and subscription-based models.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> The following task is only required if you have purchased a consumption-based license model.

"Consumption-based" means that you pay for the time you use the service, and allows users to consume Cloud Integration services based on this strategy. The advantage of a consumption-based account is that you can configure and provision Cloud Integration tenants with minimal intervention from SAP. This method of enablement allows users to provision tenants either in production or non-production environments.

> ### Note:  
> The global accounts provided with a consumption-based account are different from the global accounts offered in the existing subscription model.
