# Add Integration Packages to the Customer Workspace



## Prerequisites

You have logged-on to the Web application with the integration developer role.



## Context

You have to add the integration packages to your customer workspace \(*Design* tab page\). This enables you to access the artifacts in that package, configure, and deploy them. There are two options to do this:

1.  Copy integration package from catalog \(*Discover* tab page\) to your customer workspace.

2.  Upload integration package from your local file system to your customer workspace.


You use this procedure to add integration packages to your customer workspace.

> ### Note:  
> If you want to copy a package that already exists in your workspace, you can decide to overwrite the existing package or to add a suffix to the package name and create a new one. When you decide to add a suffix, the suffix is added to both the package ID and the IDs of all existing artifacts/integration flows. This way, updates for packages and artifacts with suffixes function the same way like for any other standard content. See: [Updates for SAP's Integration Packages](updates-for-sap-s-integration-packages-5e41ce8.md).
> 
> If you want to import a package, you can decide to overwrite the existing package or to cancel the import. You don’t have the option to add a suffix.
