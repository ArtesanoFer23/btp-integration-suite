# Working with Prepackaged Integration Content

SAP delivers rich prepackaged integration content out of the box that enables you get started quickly. These integration packages are created for some of the commonly used integration scenarios. They contain integration flows, value mappings, documentation, and so on. By using this content, you can easily get started with minimal integration developer effort.

> ### Note:  
> You can also find integration content from SAP partners in the *Discover* tab. If you're viewing the package in *Highlights* section, they can be identified by the tag *Partner* on the top-right part of the integration package tile. You can also find these packages by filtering for the *Vendor* with any other available value apart from SAP.
> 
> You can't download content from integration packages by SAP partner vendors.

In the *Overview* tab of the package, you can find detailed description about the package. You also find the *Support Info* that shows the correct support component for the package. The support component helps you report incidents to the right SAP support team when you face issues with the content of the package.

Copy the prepackaged content to your design workspace, configure it, and deploy it.

You can also access prepackaged content on the SAP API Business Hub: [https://api.sap.com/products/SAPCloudPlatform/integrations/packages](https://api.sap.com/products/SAPCloudPlatform/integrations/packages).
