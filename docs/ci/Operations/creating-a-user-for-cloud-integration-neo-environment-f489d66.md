## Context

> ### Note:  
> This information is relevant only when you use SAP Cloud Integration in the Neo environment.

There are two types of users who can access SAP Cloud Integration:

1.  **S-User**: If you have an S-User ID, you are automatically a member of blogs.sap.com.
2.  **P-User**: If you do not have an S-User ID, you can create a public user \(P-User\) account directly by refering to this [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/08/17/creating-a-technical-user-for-cloud-platform-integration/).

After you have created a new user account, you can find your user ID in your account settings.
