# Authorizing Users or User Groups

You need to authorize selected users or user groups to access the tenant and to perform specific tasks.

## Prerequisites

-   You have the Administrator role for the subaccount. You have the user IDs of the members that you want to add.

-   Only users with a valid S-user or P-user ID can be added as members of the tenant.




## Context

You perform these steps to authorize selected people to work on the account as part of the integration team, you assign roles to the associated users. You might also need to authorize technical users of sender systems to process messages on the tenant.

Once you have verified that you have administrator access and have added any additional administrators required, you can assign users or groups of users who will work on SAP Cloud Integration scenarios and grant them the necessary authorizations.

Furthermore, you can give permissions on two different detail levels:

-   You can give permissions for a typical set of tasks associated with a persona such like an integration developer. In that case, you assign an authorization group to the user.

    More information: [Persona](../SecurityNeo/persona-2937e5c.md)

-   You can give the permission for an individual task such like

    monitoring messages. In that case, you assign an individual role to the user.

    More information: [Tasks and Permissions](../SecurityNeo/tasks-and-permissions-556d557.md)


> ### Note:  
> An authorization group is composed of a set of individual roles.

You can give permissions either for individual users or for user groups.
