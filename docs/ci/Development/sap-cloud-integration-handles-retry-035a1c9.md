# SAP Cloud Integration Handles Retry

The sender doesn't retry messages.

Therefore, Cloud Integration needs to carry out the retry of the message delivery if there's an error.

Cloud Integration can handle retries with the following components \(for example\):

-   JMS adapter with JMS queue

-   XI sender adapter
