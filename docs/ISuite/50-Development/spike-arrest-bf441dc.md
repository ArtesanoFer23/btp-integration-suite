# Spike Arrest

The Spike Arrest policy limits the number of requests forwarded from the point in the processing flow where the policy is attached as a processing step.

You can attach a Spike Arrest policy at the proxy endpoint or the target endpoint. At the proxy endpoint, this policy limits inbound requests. When you attach this policy at the TargetEndpoint, it limits request forwarded to the backend service.

Unlike Quotas, spike arrests are not implemented as counts. Rather, they are implemented as a rate limit which is based on the time the last matching message was processed. If you specify 6 messages per minute, it means that requests can only be submitted at the rate of one per 10 second interval. A second request within 10 seconds on the same API Management server will be rejected. Even with a larger number \(200 per second\), if two requests come in nearly simultaneously to the same API Management server, one will be rejected. Each successful request will update the spike arrest's last processed count.

No counter is maintained for spike arrests, only a time that the last message was successfully passed through the Spike Arrest policy. On a given API Management server, if a request is received now, all subsequent requests will fail until 10 seconds has elapsed. Since Spike Arrest is not distributed, you might see some discrepancy between the actual behavior of the system and your expected results. In general, you should use Spike Arrest to set a limit that throttles traffic to what your backend services can handle. Do not use Spike Arrest to limit traffic from individual clients.

You can attach the policy in the following locations: ![](images/flow_policy_1_1aa837c.png)

An example payload for the policy is as follows:

> ```
> 
> <!-- The policy will limit the number of calls to 30 per minute for a user by refering to user id in the header -->

Specifies the weight defined for each message.

Message weight is used to modify the impact of a single request on the calculation of the SpikeArrest limit. Message weight can be set by variables based on HTTP headers, query parameters, or message body content. For example, if the SpikeArrest Rate is 10 per minute, and an application submits requests with weight 5, then only 2 messages are permitted per minute from that application.
