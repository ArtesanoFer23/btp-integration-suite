# Inspect Top Integration Flows by Message Processing Log Count

Inspect the count of message processing logs by integration flows for a given time period \(as selected with the *Time* parameter\). Only integration flows identified as those for which most message processing logs are written are displayed.

Integration flows are sorted top-down according to the count of message processing logs.

The color shade of a cell reflects the count of message processing logs.

Using the *Message Processing Status* combo box, you can filter the count of message processing logs by status. The default value is *All*. That means, the total count of message processing logs is displayed.

Click a cell to get more context information and to get access to the following functions \(results are filtered according to the setting of the *Time* parameter\):

-   *Show Messages*

    Navigate to the *Monitor Message Processing* screen for the time period covered by the bar \(see [Monitor Message Processing](monitor-message-processing-314df3f.md)\).

-   *Copy Name to Clipboard* 

    Copy the integration flow name to the clipboard.


*Zoom Out* and *Zoom In* to extend/reduce the selected time period.â€ƒ
