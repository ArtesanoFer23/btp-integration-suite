# Perform Connectivity Tests

You can test the connectivity to a receiver system.

To access the connectivity tests, choose the tile *Connectivity Tests*, in the *Manage Security* section.

Select the runtime in which you want to perform the connectivity tests, from the runtime drop-down box.

You can test different types of connectivity by selecting the corresponding tab. Each tab offers a *Request* form, and a *Send* button.

> ### Note:  
> You can always switch runtimes in each tab.
