# Configure Product Profile for an Integration Flow

You can use product profile in an integration flow, to develop content for a particular runtime.



## Prerequisites

-   Your user is assigned with integration developer role.
-   You have opened an integration flow in the editor.



## Context

Product profile is a collection of capabilities such as OData adapter, splitter or datastore elements, available for a particular product. You can consume these capabilities at the time of designing integration flows.

The tool enables you to design for multiple runtimes at the same time. You should select specific product profile to develop content for the respective runtime.

> ### Note:  
> If a product profile does not support a particular capability then the checks report errors for unsupported components in the integration flow.



## Procedure

1.  Choose the *Runtime Configuration* tab page.

2.  Select relevant product profile from the *Product Profile* dropdown list.

    > ### Note:  
    > -   If you want to publish content in the catalog, then it is a recommendation to select a specific product profile.
    > 
    > -   If you switch product profiles, then the system reloads the palette and displays relevant capabilities.

3.  Choose *Save* or *Deploy* as appropriate.
